Many applications of Simulator Controller provide a couple of modifier keys for several functions. Find a list of all those modifiers and their functionalities below. Many modifier keys are also mentioned in the respective documentation, but here you have a complete overview.

| Application   | Function | Modifier | Description |
|---------------|----------|----------|-------------|
| Applications | Exiting an application from the tray menu | Control | When control is held down, the application will exit, even if it is still working on some background tasks. |
| Solo Center | Loading a Session    | Control  | If you hold down the Control key while selecting the "Load Session..." command in the "Session" menu, you can load sessions stored in the old data format, which has been used, before sessions where stored in the session database by default. |
| | Displaying reports    | Control  | Reports are normally displayed in the *Output* view in the lower right corner of the main window. Holding down the Control key will open them in a separate window. |
| | Deleting lap telemetry | Control | When holding down the Control key while deleting the selected lap telemetry, **all** telemetry laps will be removed from the Telemetry Viewer. |
| | Shifting telemetry graph | Control / Control + Shift | When shifting the reference telemetry graph to the left or to the right, it will be shifted by 10 meters, if the Control key is held down, or by 50 meters, if Control and Shift keys are held down. |
| Race Assistants | Finishing a session | Control + Shift | Normally, the Race Assistants will wait for a specific cooldown time, before they startup again. While in training sessions against AI racers, you can skip this cooldown period with holding the Control together with the Shift key in the moment, when the Assistants detect a session change. But be aware, that all post-processing, like saving telemetry data or creating a race report will be skipped as well. |
| Team Center   | Startup    | Control  | If the Control key is pressed when starting the "Team Center", it will start with session synchronzation disabled. Only the basic data (stint plan, strategy, driver selection, tyre setups and so on) is loaded, but no session data like stints, laps, telemetry information, etc. |
| | Startup    | Alt  | The "Team Center" comes in two flavours with regards to the user interface. Holding down the Alt key while starting "Team Center" will start the Lite version with a very much simplified user interface. |
| | Login    | Control  | If you hold down the Control key while pressing on the button with a small key to connect to a session, a login dialog pops up and you can use the team manager account name and password instead of a token to connect to a team session. |
