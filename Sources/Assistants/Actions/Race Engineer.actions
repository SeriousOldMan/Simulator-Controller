recalculate_damage_impact=Assistant.Rule|Race Engineer.recalculate_damage_impact.rules|false|true|0|Resets the damage impact calculation and then starts a full recalculation of the time loss caused by the damage.
[Conversation.Actions.Parameters]
plan_pitstop.1=targetLap|Integer||false|The planned lap for the car to come to the pit.
plan_pitstop.2=refuelAmount|Number||false|The amount of fuel to be filled into the car.
plan_pitstop.3=tyreCompounds|String||false|If a tyre change is requested the compound for the new tyres can be supplied. If individual tyre compounds should be supplied for each wheel or each axle, they must be separated by a ",". In this case, a "-" indicates that the tyre for this wheel or axle must not be changed.
plan_pitstop.4=repairDamage|Boolean||false|Indicates whether all damages should be repaired.
plan_pitstop.5=swapDriver|Boolean||false|Indicates in a team race whether the next driver according to the stint plan should take the car.
