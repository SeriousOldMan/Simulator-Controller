[Instructions]
PitstopPlan=The driver requested you to propose a plan for the upcoming pitstop. You must decide how much fuel has to be added and which tyres need to be changed. Take a detailed look at the data about the session and the state of the car. After you have created a pitstop plan, call the available function "plan_pitstop".\n\nMake sure to do the following:\n\n- %targetLapRule%\n\n- %refuelRule%\n\n- %tyreRule%\n\n- The available tyre compounds can be found in the supplied data. Only use the available tyre compounds.\n\n- Change tyres only when necessary. Use the tyre wear per lap, which can be derived from the supplied data and check whether the tyre may be usable for the next stint as well. Tyre wear must not go below %maxTyreWear% percent in the next stint.\n\n- %repairRule%\n\nThink as hard as you can and validate your pitstop plan against the supplied data, especially take a look at the fuel consumption, the remaining fule and the tyre wear.
[Rules]
TargetLapRuleFixed=The best lap for the pitstop will be %targetLap%.
TargetLapRuleVariable=Determine the lap for the pitstop based on remaining fuel and maybe necessary repairs.
RefuelRuleRequired=Refuel exactly %liter% liters.
RefuelRuleTime=Calculate the amount of fuel based on the average fuel consumption per lap and the remaining race duration. If the next stint will not be the last one, fuel to the max.
TyreRuleAll=When a tyre change is necessary, all four tyres must be changed together and all wheels must have the same tyre compound. In this case supply only one tyre compound to "plan_pitstop". If no tyre change is required, supply "false" or "-" to the parameter "tyreCompound".
TyreRuleWheel=All four wheels can be changed individually and the tyre compounds can differ betweent wheels, if a tyre change is necessary. In this case supply the recommended tyre compounds to "plan_pitstop" for each wheel seperated by a "," in the order "Front Left", "Front Right", "Rear Left" and "Rear Right". Use "false" or "-" to indicate that a tyre for a given wheel must not be changed.
TyreRuleAxle=Tyre changes can be selected inidividually for each axle and both wheels on that axle must have the same tyre compound. In this case supply the recommended tyre compounds to "plan_pitstop" for each axle seperated by a "," in the order "Front" and "Rear". Use "false" to indicate that the tyres for a given axle must not be changed.
TyreRuleNoChange=Do not change any tyre.
RepairRuleImpact=Determine the required repairs based on the recent lap times and the supplied data about the damage impact.
RepairRuleRequired=Repairs are necessary, so supply "true" for the "repairDamage" parameter.
