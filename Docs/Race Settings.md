The following table will give you an overview over all settings, which are available in the session database. As described [here](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Session-Database#race-settings), this settings can be defined precisely for a given simulator / car / track / weather combo and will overwrite the settings you have chosen in the "Race Settings" dialog. This allows you to automate most of the settings required for an upcoming session.

### General settings

This settings are generally available, although you can and have to define them specific for a given simulator / car / track / weather combo as described. Further down below you can find additional settings, which are not generally available, but are specific for a selected simulator.

|            | Strategy summary at race start           | Boolean | True                            | No  | If enabled (*True*), the Strategist will give a summary of the active strategy in one of the first laps of the race. |
|            | Strategy summary after each update       | Boolean | True                            | No  | If enabled (*True*), the Strategist will give a summary of the new strategy after each update. Please note, that strategy updates must be enabled in the settings. Also note, that setting this to *False* may be confusing, if you require a confirmation of a strategy update on the other hand, since it would not be obvious what will be confirmed. |
|            | Strategy summary before pitstop          | Boolean | False                           | No  | If enabled (*True*), the Strategist will give a summary of the active strategy just before an upcoming pitstop. This can be enabled as an alternative to the other settings above. |
| Strategy   | Position Extrapolation                   | Integer | 3                               | Yes | The Strategist permanently simulates the events of the upcoming laps depending on the development of the recent laps to predict future race standings. This information is used for example for pitstop recommendations and strategy updates. This value specifies, how many laps into the future will be calculated on each crossing of the start / finish line. Attention: High values might result in high CPU consumption. |
|            | Overtake Delta                           | Integer | 1                               | Yes | During simulation of the future race development, the Strategist will also take overtaking into account. This value defines the time loss for both cars in seconds according to this formula: Abs( X / laptime difference), where *X* is the value entered here. |
|            | Pitlane Delta                            | Integer | 60                              | Yes | The time difference in seconds between drive by and drive through of the pitlane. |
|            | Pitstop Variation Window (+/- Lap)       | Integer | 3                               | Yes | Specifies, how many laps before an after the projected pitstop (depending on available fuel), the Strategist will simulate to create his recommendation for an upcoming pitstop. Also used in the dynamic traffic simulation to specify the number of laps the simulation is allowed to deviate from the pitstop lap derived by linear calculation. As said, remaining fuel is taken into account, so if you want to be able to delay your pitstop long enough, be sure, to increase the amount of safety fuel as well. |
|            | Traffic Track Length                       | Integer | 5                               | Yes | Specifies the length of the track (in percentage of the overall length) which will be considered in traffic density calculations by the Strategist. Used both in pitstop recommendations derived by linear calculations as well as in the dynamic traffic simulation using the Monte Carlo method. |
|            | Dynamic Traffic Simulation (Monte Carlo)   | Boolean | false                             | No | If this setting is enabled, the Strategist will use a Monte Carlo simulation model to create a probability distribution for the further race development, thereby finding the best possible lap for the next pitstop (see this [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method) entry for an introduction to Monte Carlo methods). Once enabled, you can use the following settings to fine tune the probability distrubution and the depth of search. WARNING: This will consume lots of CPU cycles and can take quite some time. It is strongly advised, to let this setting disabled, unless you own a really powerful PC. In team races, it is possible to run the Monte Carlo simulation in the "Team Center", thereby offloading the computational load from the drivers PC. |
|            | Traffic Randomness                       | Integer | 5                               | No | [Dynamic Traffic Simulation] Specifies the general random factor for each data point in percentage. 5% means, that the given data point will defer from the value provided by a linear calculation in 5% of all cases. |
|            | Traffic Scenarios                       | Integer | 20                               | No | [Dynamic Traffic Simulation] Specifies the number of scenarios to generate before choosing the best scenario. Be aware, that each scenario in itself might contain many scenerios for tyre wear, compound mixture choices and so on, if you have used the *Optimizer* while generating the initial strategy. So be careful using high numbers here in combination with complex strategies, or you might end up waiting for a long time... |
|            | Simulate lap time variations (Consistency)       | Boolean | true                            | No | [Dynamic Traffic Simulation] If enabled, variations in lap time of you and your opponents will be taken into account according to the consistency values of past laps. |
|            | Simulate driver errors (Control)                 | Boolean | true                            | No | [Dynamic Traffic Simulation] If enabled, random off-track events and even incidents will be simulated based on the car control and previous incidents of a given driver. This will have a much larger effect than variations by generated of the drivers consistency. |
|            | Simulate opponent pitstops                       | Boolean | true                            | No | [Dynamic Traffic Simulation] Will enable the simulation of pitstops of your opponents. Recent pitstops will taken into account, if available. Otherwie a random factor is used here as well. |
|            | Autonomous Mode           | Yes, No, Custom | Custom                               | Yes | This is a very special setting. It lets you give the different Assistants a lot of autonomy and capabilities to guide you through a race without further interaction needed from your side. The setting combines a lot of settings also available seperately, namely: "Engineer: Confirm Pitstop Preparation", "Strategist: Confirm Pitstop Planning", "Strategist: Confirm Strategy Update" and "Strategist: Confirm Strategy Explanation". When the value of "Autonomous Mode" is *Yes*, all these other settings are implicitly assumed to be *true*, if the value is *No*, all these other settings are assumed to be *false*, and if the value is *Custom*, those settings are used as they are specified. Therefore, if you set "Autonomous Mode" to *Yes*, the Strategist and the Engineer will work together during strategy planning and execution without asking the driver for confirmation. |
|            | Automatic recalculation (Laps)           | Integer | 0                               | Yes | If there is an active strategy for the current session, the Strategist can try to optimize this strategy on behalf of the current race situation and will inform the driver if a better strategy can be derived, who then can decide to *activate* the new strategy. This setting specifies the number of laps between each recalculation, with **0** meaning no recalculation at all. Enabling this will put a high demand on the CPU, so test it before using it in an important race. |
|            | Automatic recalculation (Pitstop)        | Integer | 0                               | Yes | If there is an active strategy for the current session, the Strategist can try to adjust this strategy when an upplanned pitstop has been necessary. If the strategy could be adjusted to the new situation, the driver will be informed and can decide to *activate* the new strategy. This setting specifies the number of laps a pit stop may deviate from the originally planned pitstop lap, so that it is considered to be in line with the strategy. **0** als means here no recalculation at all. Enabling this will put a high demand on the CPU after a pitstop, so test it before using it in an important race. |
| Team Session | Cooldown                                | Integer | 600                             | No  | Number of seconds that will be waited after a finished session before a new connection to a Team Server session will be opened. |

##### Notes

(1) The default for *iRacing* is *False*, since the simulator does not provide correct tyre pressure information while driving. This will lead to setup pressure values, which are way off, when tyres are changed at the pitstop. Therefore it might be better to manage tyre change manually. Up 2 u...
