[Instructions]
PitstopRecommend=The driver requested you to recommend the best lap for an upcoming pitstop. Take a detailed look at the data about the session and the state of the car. Very important is the information about the positions of all cars at the time of the recommended pitstop, which can be calculated based on their lap time and their current distance into the track. Check, if an undercut or overcut is possible for the driver by evaluating different scenarios. When you have come to a recommendation, call the available function "recommend_pitstop".\n\nMake sure to consider the following:\n\n- %targetLapRule%\n\n- If no pitstop is necessary due to remaining fuel and remaining session time, call "recommend_pitstop" with 0 as argument.\n\n- If the function "__explain_reasoning__" is available, call this function also to explain your thoughts and conclusions.\n\nThink as hard as you can and validate your recommendation against the supplied data, especially take a look at the position development of all cars and the remaining fuel.
[Rules]
TargetLapRuleFixed=The driver requested lap %targetLap% for the pitstop, but evaluate %deltaLaps% laps before and after this lap as well.
TargetLapRuleVariable=You are free to determine the lap for the pitstop on your own, but also take into account, how many laps are still possible with the remaining fuel.
