# Gui Classes

The base framework provide a specialized subclass of *Gui*, which supports resizing rules, customizeable closing behaviour and also basic method for applying UI themes.

## Window ([Gui.ahk](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/blob/main/Sources/Framework/Gui.ahk))

You can use the Window class anywhere you normally would use a *Gui*. Please note, that the constructor arguments work differently and the default look will be different than with a standard *Gui*.

### Public Properties

#### *Descriptor*
Returns the symbolic name of this window, which is used, for example, by the [getWindowPosition](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Functions-Reference#getwindowpositiondescriptor--string-byref-x--integer-byref-y--integer), [getWindowSize](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Functions-Reference#getwindowsizedescriptor--string-byref-w--integer-byref-h--integer) and [moveByMoue](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Functions-Reference#movebymouseguiprefix--string-descriptor--string--false) functions.

#### *Closeable*
Returns *true*, if the window is closeable. In this case, the [Close](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Classes-Reference#closerest-arguments) method is called, whenever the user wants to close the window.

#### *Resizeable*
Returns *true*, if the window is resizeable. In this case, the [Resize](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Classes-Reference#resizeminmax--string-width--integer-height--integer) method is called, whenever the user is resizing the window, or, if the value of *Resizeable* is "Deferred", **after** the window had been resized.

#### *MinWidth*
This is the mimimum width, the window is allowed to have. This property is set by default to the window width, that window had, when initially opened, bt can be set to a different size anytime.

#### *MinHeight*
This is the mimimum height, the window is allowed to have. This property is set by default to the window height, that window had, when initially opened, bt can be set to a different size anytime. 

#### *MaxWidth*
This is the mimimum width, the window is allowed to have. Default is *false*, which means unrestricted.

#### *MaxHeight*
This is the mimimum height, the window is allowed to have. Default is *false*, which means unrestricted.

#### *Width*
The current width of the window.

#### *Height*
The current height of the window.

#### *TitleBarHeight*
The height of the title bar. Returns *false*, if the window hasno displayed title bar.

#### *Resizers[control :: Gui.Control := false]*
Returns a list of all defined resizers for this window or only for the given *control*.

#### *Rules[asText :: Boolean := *true*]*
Returns the default resize rules, which will be applied automatically to all following defined controls for this window. You can either ask for textual representation or a list. Initialliy, the default rules are empty. See [DefineResizeRule](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Classes-Reference#resizeminmax--string-width--integer-height--integer) below for detailed explanation of resize rules.

### Public Methods

#### *__New(options :: Object := {}, name :: String := *Name of the application*, #rest arguments)*
Returns a new window. If yoo don*t supply any arguments, a non-closeable, non-resizeable window without a title bar will be created. The options support the following properties:

  1. Descriptor - the symbolic name of the window
  2. Closeable - whether the window is closeable (default is *false*)
  3. Resizeable - whether the window is resizeable (default is *false*)
  4. Options - all other options, which will be passed to the *Gui*
 
The optional remaining *arguments* will be passed to the *Gui* as well.

#### *ApplyTheme()*
Is called once for a new window, to set the basic theming, like the background color.

#### *ApplyThemeOptions(type :: String, options : String)*
This method is called for each control, before it is created. The method can change inidividual options like color, etc., to apply target theming. The method must return the probably modified *options*.

#### *ApplyThemeProperties(control :: Gui.Control)*
This method is called for each control, after it has been created, also here to apply optical changes.

#### *AddResizer(resizer :: Window.Resizer)*
Adds a resizer to the list of resizers for this window. Must not be called manually (use the inherited *Add* method for custom resizers as well as controls), but you can overwrite it, to do some additional work here.

#### *DefineResizeRule(control :: Gui.Control, rule :: String)*
Also called automatically from *Add*. *rule* can consist of multiple resize actions separated by spaces. A resize action looks like this:

  *Property*:*Action*[(*Factor*)

  1. Property must be one of *x*, *y*, *w* (*width*), *h* (*height*), *v* (*vertical*) or *h* (*horizontal*) 
  2. Action must be one of *Move*, *Grow* or *Center*
  3. Factor can be any numeric value (normally a value between 0 and 1), which effects the amount of change applid to the property

Examples:

  - X:Move(0.33) - The control is move to the right by 1/3 of the increase of the window site.
  - W:Grow - The control grows in width by the amount the window has grown horizontally.
  - V:Center - The control is centered vertically in the window area.

Please note, that you don't have to call *DefineResizeRule* manually. Simply include the resize rules into the options string, when add ing a new control to the window using the *Add* method.

#### *Close(#rest arguments)*
Will be called, when the window is closed by the user. The default method simply calls *ExitApp(0)*

#### *Resize(minMax :: String, width :: Integer, height :: Integer)*
Is called periodically, when the user is resizing the window. The default implementation applies the resiz rules.

## [Abstract Class] Window.Resizer ([Gui.ahk](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/blob/main/Sources/Framework/Gui.ahk))

Instances of this class do the actual work, when a window is beeing resized. Most of the them will work on a given control (actually implemented in a private subclass), but you can define als custom resizers, which, for example, will reload a HTML document, after a window had been resized.

### Public Properties

#### *Window*
Returns the window, for which this resizer has been defined.

#### *Control*
Must return the control object, when the resizer is specific for a given control.

### Public Methods

#### *__New(window :: Window)* 
Basic constructor, which sets the *Window* property.

#### *Initialize()*
Is called one, after the window has been created initially. Use this method to initialize some information, for example, the initial position and size of the handled control.

#### *RestrictResize(&deltaWidth :: Integer, &deltaHeight :: Integer)*
Is called during resizing. You can alter the supplied values of *deltaWidth* and *deltaHeight* (in window coordinate system) to restrict the resizing. Return *true*, if the resizing should actually be restricted.

#### *Resize(deltaWidth :: Integer, deltaHeight :: Integer)*
The window had been resized already, when this method is called. Apply any changes, this resizer is responsible for.

#### *Redraw()*
Called during resizing to redraw parts of the window. If you want the redraw to happen only once, after the resizing is finished, start a task which checks the mouse buttons and do the redraw, after the user has released the mount buttons.

# Collections Classes

This part of the framework define a couple of convenience collection classes to achieve special behaviour when accessing collection elements. Some of this bahviour mimics that of the previous AutoHotkey language version, thereby preserving the functionality of the applications implementation.

## CaseSenseMap ([Collections.ahk](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/blob/main/Sources/Framework/Collections.ahk))
Defines a hash map, that uses case sensitive keys. Actually the standard of the builtin *Map* class, but the name of the class documments this property.

## CaseInsenseMap ([Collections.ahk](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/blob/main/Sources/Framework/Collections.ahk))
Defines a hash map, that uses case insensitive keys, which was the dfault behaviour of the object properties in AutoHotkey V1.

## WeakArray ([Collections.ahk](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/blob/main/Sources/Framework/Collections.ahk))
Implements an array which returns an empty string, rather than throwing an error, when a non-existent index is accessed.

## WeakMap ([Collections.ahk](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/blob/main/Sources/Framework/Collections.ahk))
Returns a (case sensitive) hash map, which returns an empty string, rather than throwing an error, when a non-existent key is used. Beside that, integers and strings containing integers are considered as similar, when used as keys.

## CaseSenseWeakMap ([Collections.ahk](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/blob/main/Sources/Framework/Collections.ahk))
Synonymous to *WeakMap*.

## CaseInsenseWeakMap ([Collections.ahk](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/blob/main/Sources/Framework/Collections.ahk))
Adds the case insensitive property to "WeakMap*.

***

# Configuration Classes

The following classes are defined in the [Configuration.ahk](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/blob/main/Sources/Framework/Configuration.ahk) script. They define objects, that can be loaded from or can be saved to a configuration file maintained by the [configuration tool](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Installation-&-Configuration#configuration). Many of these classes will be subclassed and extended with more functionality in other files of the Simulator Controller framework, especially in the script [Simulator Controller.ahk](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/blob/main/Sources/Controller/Simulator%20Controller.ahk). These classes are described [further down below](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Classes-Reference#controller-classes).

## [Abstract] ConfigurationItem ([Configuration.ahk](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/blob/main/Sources/Framework/Configuration.ahk))

This is the base class for all objects, that can be stored to or retrieved from a configuration file. Generally, configurations are maintaned by the [configuration tool](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Installation-&-Configuration#configuration). During runtime, all configuration data is accessible through the global constant *kSimulatorConfiguration*.

### Public Properties

#### *Configuration*
The configuration map this item belongs to, or *false*, if the item wasn't created from a configuration.

### Public Methods

#### *__New(configuration :: ConfigurationMap := false)*
If the optional configuration map has been supplied, the method loadFromConfiguration will be invoked automatically.

#### *loadFromConfiguration(configuration :: ConfigurationMap)*
May be overriden by a subclass to read and initialize the item instance variables from the given configuration map. Implementations may generally look like this:

	loadFromConfiguration(configuration) {
		base.loadFromConfiguration(configuration)

		for functionDescriptor, descriptorValues in getMultiMapValues(configuration, "Controller Functions", Object()) {
			functionDescriptor := ConfigurationItem.splitDescriptor(functionDescriptor)
			
			if ((functionDescriptor[1] == this.Type) && (functionDescriptor[2] == this.Number))
				this.loadFromDescriptor(functionDescriptor[3], descriptorValues)
		}
	}

#### *saveToConfiguration(configuration :: ConfigurationMap)*
Typically invoked by the configuration tool, this method needs to write the item state to the configuration map. Implementations may generally look like this:

	saveToConfiguration(configuration) {
		base.saveToConfiguration(configuration)
		
		descriptor := this.Descriptor
		
		for ignore, trigger in this.Trigger {
			setMultiMapValue(configuration, "Controller Functions", descriptor . "." . trigger, this.Hotkeys[trigger, true])
			setMultiMapValue(configuration, "Controller Functions", descriptor . "." . trigger . " Action", this.Actions[trigger, true])
		}
	}

#### [Class Method] *descriptor(#rest values)*
Returns a descriptor string to identify a configuration item in a configuration map. For example, calling *ConfigurationItem.descriptor("Button", 5)* yields "Button.5" as its result.

#### [Class Method] *splitDescriptor(descriptor :: String)*
Returns an array with all different parts of the supplied descriptor string.

***

## Application extends [ConfigurationItem](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Classes-Reference#abstract-configurationitem-configurationahk) ([Configuration.ahk](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/blob/main/Sources/Framework/Configuration.ahk))
This configuration item represents an application in the current Windows installation.

### Public Properties

#### *Application*
Returns the logical name of this application.

#### *ExePath*
Returns the name of the executable file in the file system.
	
#### *WorkingDirectory*
Returns the directory, where the application will be executed.
	
#### *WindowTitle*
Returns the pattern used to identify an active window for the given application. Fully supports the AutoHotkey *winTitle* syntax. See the AutoHotkey [documentation](https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/misc/WinTitle.htm) for reference.
	
#### *SpecialStartup*
Returns the name of a script function to be invoked as a special startup method, or *false*, if no special startup method is applicable. Special startup methods may be defined to perform some additional tasks, after an application has been started, or to provide a custom splash screen, for example. See the [ACC Plugin](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/blob/main/Sources/Plugins/ACC%20Plugin.ahk) for an example of a custom splash screen.
Important: Script functions used as special startup handler must return the rpocess id of the started application.

#### *SpecialShutdown*
Returns the name of a script function to be invoked as a special shutdown method, or *false*, if no special shutdown method is applicable. Ses the ACC Plugin mentioned above for an example as well.
	
#### *SpecialIsRunning*
Returns the name of the special script function used to test whether the application is running, or *false*, if no special method is applicable.
	
#### *CurrentPID*
If the application is running and has been started by the *startup* method below, this property returns the Windows process id associated with the running process.

### Public Methods

#### *__New(application :: String, configuration :: ConfigurationMap := false, exePath :: String := "", workingDirectory :: String := "", windowTitle :: String := "", specialStartup :: String := "", specialShutdown :: String := "", specialIsRunning :: String := "")*
Constructs a new configurable application item. If the configuration argument is not supplied or *false*, all properties may be set with corresponding arguments.

#### *startup(special :: Boolean := true, wait :: Boolean := false, options :: String := "")*
Starts the given application and returns the process id. If *special* is supplied and *false*, a potential special startup method will not be used. If *wait* is supplied and *true*, the call to *startup* will wait until the application terminates and the result code will be returned instead of the process id. *options* are passed to the underlying [*Run* or *RunWait*](https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/commands/Run.htm) command of AutoHotkey.

#### *shutdown(special :: Boolean := true)*
Stops the given application, potentially using a special method, if defined and not suppressed by supplying *special* as *false*.

#### *isRunning(special :: Boolean := true)*
Returns *true*, if the application is currently running, potentially using the defined special function.

#### [Class Method] *run(application :: String, exePath :: String, workingDirectory :: String, options :: String := "", wait :: Boolean := false)*
Low level method to start Windows applications. See above functions for an explanation of all the parameters.

## [Abstract] Function extends [ConfigurationItem](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Classes-Reference#abstract-configurationitem-configurationahk) ([Configuration.ahk](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/blob/main/Sources/Framework/Configuration.ahk))
This abstract class defines the protocol for all functions available for a given controller hardware. A function, which might be buttons, dials and swwitches, defines actions, which react to triggers. To connect to the underlying hardware, a controller function defines several [hotkeys](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Installation-&-Configuration#hotkeys) per trigger, which is used by AutoHotkey to detect that a button has been pressed, a dial rotated and so on. At this point, the actions that might be triggered will be simple calls to global function in the script language, but more versatile capabilites will be defined by the [plugin framework](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Development-Overview-&-Concepts#overview), where actions will be implemented by specialized classes.

### Public Properties

#### [Abstract] *Type*
Returns the [type constant](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Constants-Reference#controller-function-types-constantsahk) of the given function. This property must be implemented by a concrete subclass.
	
#### *Number*
Returns the running number of the controller function. For example Button # **3**...
	
#### *Descriptor*
The resource descriptor of the given function. Typically looks like "Button.3" or "Dial.2".
	
#### [Abstract] *Trigger*
Returns a list of all triggers available for this controller function. A button class might return ["Push"], beacause only this single functionality is provided, whereas a dial function might return ["Increase", "Decrease"].
	
#### *Hotkeys[trigger :: String := false, asText :: Boolean := false]*
Returns all the hotkeys for the triggers handled by this controller function. Depending on the first argument, this might be a map for all triggers or the result for one specific trigger. The second argument determines, what is returned for a specific trigger, either directly or as part of the map. When *asText* has not been supplied or is *false*, a list of all hotkeys is returned. If supplied and *true*, one single string representation is returned, where all the hotkeys are delimited by " | ", for example "<^<!F1 | Joy2".

#### *Actions[trigger :: String := false, asText :: Boolean := false]*
Similar to the *Hotkeys* property, this property returns the defined actions. The textual representation of an action looks like a script fragment, like "startSimulator(Assetto Corsa Competizione)", whereas the non-text representation is a callable function object.

### Public Methods

#### *__New(functionNumber :: Integer, configuration :: ConfigurationMap := false, #rest hotkeyActions)*
Constructs a new controller function. If *configuration* is not supplied, the hotkeys and actions must be supplied as string arguments for all triggers in the order returned by the *Trigger* property. The class factory method *createFunction* may be used to create an instance of a specific subclass.

#### *fireAction(trigger)*
Calls the action function defined for the given trigger, if any.

#### [Class Factory Method] *createFunction(descriptor :: String, configuration :: ConfigurationMap := false, onHotkeys :: String := false, onAction :: String := false, offHotkeys :: String := false, offAction :: String := false)*
Creates an instance of a specific subclass of *Function* according to the given descriptor. If *configuration* is *false*, the additional arguments may be used to initialize hotkeys and triggerable actions in the order of the defined triggers returned by the property *Trigger*.

## TwoWayToggleFunction extends [Function](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Classes-Reference#abstract-function-extends-configurationitem-configurationahk) ([Configuration.ahk](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/blob/main/Sources/Framework/Configuration.ahk))
Concrete implementation for two state toggle switches, like On/Off switches. The triggers returned by *Trigger* are ["On", "Off"].

***

## OneWayToggleFunction extends [Function](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Classes-Reference#abstract-function-extends-configurationitem-configurationahk) ([Configuration.ahk](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/blob/main/Sources/Framework/Configuration.ahk))
Concrete implementation for single state switches, for example a momentary ignition switch. The triggers returned by *Trigger* are ["On"].

***

## ButtonFunction extends [Function](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Classes-Reference#abstract-function-extends-configurationitem-configurationahk) ([Configuration.ahk](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/blob/main/Sources/Framework/Configuration.ahk))
Concrete implementation for simple push buttons. The triggers returned by *Trigger* are ["Push"].

***

## DialFunction extends [Function](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Classes-Reference#abstract-function-extends-configurationitem-configurationahk) ([Configuration.ahk](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/blob/main/Sources/Framework/Configuration.ahk))
Concrete implementation for rotary dials. The triggers returned by *Trigger* are ["Increase", "Decrease"] for the two different rotary directions.

***

## CustomFunction extends [Function](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Classes-Reference#abstract-function-extends-configurationitem-configurationahk) ([Configuration.ahk](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/blob/main/Sources/Framework/Configuration.ahk))
Concrete implementation for a custom or external function. The triggers returned by *Trigger* are ["Call"] for a generic activation of the function. Normally, custom functions are not bound to a hardware controller, but serve as an interface for other event sources, like a voice control software or a keyboard macro tool.

***

## Plugin extends [ConfigurationItem](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Classes-Reference#abstract-configurationitem-configurationahk) ([Configuration.ahk](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/blob/main/Sources/Framework/Configuration.ahk))
A plugin is used by the Simulator Controller framework to integrate custom code and extensions. Plugins can be configured by the [configuration tool](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Installation-&-Configuration#configuration). Especially the more complex plugins may define a set of configuration parameters to define the function mapping, initial values for dynamic parameters, and so on. A special subclass named [ControllerPlugin](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Classes-Reference#controllerplugin-extends-plugin-simulator-controllerahk) exists, which provides additional functionality to interact with the single instance of [SimulatorController](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Classes-Reference#singleton-simulatorcontroller-extends-configurationitem-simulator-controllerahk), handle plugin modes and connect to controller functions. The base class *Plugin* only provides the functionality necessary for configuration reading and writing.

### Public Properties

#### *Plugin*
Returns the name of the plugin.

#### *Active*
Returns *true*, if the plugin is to be considered active according to the configuration.
	
#### *Simulators*
Returns a list of names of simulation games, this plugin is aware of. In the default implementation, the modes of a given plugin will only be active, if one of these simulators is currently running. If the list is empty, the plugin and its modes are independently active.

#### *Arguments[asText := false]*
Returns a map of all arguments supplied to the plugin, or, if *asText* has been supplied and is *true*, a string representation, which can be stored in the configuration map.

### Public Methods

#### *__New(plugin :: String, configuration :: ConfigurationMap := false, active :: Boolean := false, simulators :: String := "", arguments :: String := "")*
Constructs a new plugin instance. If *configuration* has been supplied, the instance is initialized from the configuration. Otherwise the *simulators* may be a ","-delimited string of simulator names and arguments might supply all the plugin arguments also in their texutal representation, which follows the following format: "parameter1: value11, value12, value13; parameter2: value21, value22; ..."

#### *hasArgument(parameter :: String)*
Returns *true*, if an argument with values has been supplied for the given parameter name.
	
#### *getArgumentValue(argument :: String, default := false)*
Returns the values for the given argument as string, or the supplied *default* value otherwise.
	
***

# Configuration Editor Classes

The two classes *ConfigurationEditor* and *ConfigurationItemList* implement the configuration tool framework. The conifguration tool can be extended by registering so called configurators, which, in the end, will add a tab in the dialog of the configuration tool. Please see the corresponding documentation on [Customizing the Configuration Tool](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Development-Overview-&-Concepts#customizing-the-configuration-tool) for more information.

## [Singleton] ConfigurationEditor extends [ConfigurationItem](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Classes-Reference#abstract-configurationitem-configurationahk) ([Simulator Configuration.ahk](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/blob/main/Sources/Configuration/Simulator%20Configuration.ahk))
This is the main class of the configuration tool. It opens the editor window and creates a tabbed view for all the configurator plugins.

### Public Properties

#### [Class] *Instance*
This class property returns the single instance of *ConfigurationEditor*.

#### *Configurators*
A list of all registered configurators, which tpically have been provided by configuration plugins by calling [registerConfigurator](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Classes-Reference#registerconfiguratorlabel--string-configurator--configurationitem).

#### *AutoSave*
Returns *true*, if the user wants each change to be updated automatically.
	
#### *Window*
This property returns the short string, which is used by all AutoHotKey *Gui* commands to identify the window of the configuration editor.

### Public Methods

#### *__New(development :: Boolean, configuration :: ConfigurationMap)*
Constructs a new *ConfigurationEditor* instance. If *true* is passed for the first parameter, additional configuration options suitable for development tasks will be available in the first tab of the configuration editor. The second parameter is the configuration, which should be modified.

#### *registerConfigurator(label :: String, configurator :: ConfigurationItem)*
Registers the given configurator and creates a tab with the given label for it in the tabbed view of the configuration editor window. The registered *configurator* object will typically be an instance of a subclass of [ConfigurationItem](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Classes-Reference#abstract-configurationitem-configurationahk) and must implement a simple additional protocol, as described in the documentation on [Customizing the Configuration Tool](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Development-Overview-&-Concepts#customizing-the-configuration-tool).

	class MyConfigurator extends ConfigurationItem {
		createGui(editor :: ConfigurationEditor, x :: Integer, y :: Integer, width :: Integer, height :: Integer) { ... }

		loadFromConfiguration(configuration) { ... }

		saveToConfiguration(configuration) { ... }
	}
	
The method *createGui* is called by the *editor* to create the controls for the configuration plugin. All controls must be created using the AutoHotkey *Gui* command in the window defined by *editor.Window* in the boundaries *x* <-> (*x* + *width*) and *y* <-> (*y* + *height*).
*loadFromConfiguration* (inherited from [ConfigurationItem][https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Classes-Reference#abstract-configurationitem-configurationahk]) is called during the initialization process. It must load the initial state from the configuration. Please note, that the *createGui* method had not been called yet. The third method of the protocol, *saveToConfiguration* (also inherited from *ConfigurationItem*), will be called, whenever the user wants to save the current state of the configuration tool.

#### *unregisterConfigurator(labelOrConfigurator :: TypeUnion(String, Object))*
Removes a configurator (either identified directly as argument or identified by the label, which had been supplied, when registering the configurator), from the configuration tool.

#### *show()*
After all configurators have been registered, *show* will open the editor window for interaction.

#### *hide()*
Makes the main editor window invisble, which might be useful, when a specialized or delegated editor will be opened by one of the plugins.

#### *close()*
Called at the end, after all modifications had been saved (by calling the inherited method [saveToConfiguration](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Classes-Reference#savetoconfigurationconfiguration--configurationmap)), to finally close and destroy the editor window.

#### *toggleKeyDetector(callback :: Func := false)*
Calling *toggleKeyDetector* enables or disables a special tool to detect buttons and dials on connected hardware controlles. A small tooltip will follow the mouse and display information as long as these controls are activated. If you supply the *callback*, it will be called with the first pressed control in AutoHotkey [hotkey syntax](https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/KeyList.htm) and the key detector tool will be deactivated automatically.

***

## [Abstract] ConfigurationItemList extends [ConfigurationItem](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Classes-Reference#abstract-configurationitem-configurationahk) ([Simulator Configuration.ahk](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/blob/main/Sources/Configuration/Simulator%20Configuration.ahk))
This abstract class implements a list of items, which might be edited with an associated editor. Basis control on item selection, openening and closing the editor area, loading and saving items to and from the editor is already builtin. Please see the [implementation for the "Chat Messages Configuration" plugin](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/blob/main/Sources/Plugins/Chat%20Messages%20Configuration%20Plugin.ahk) for a simple example of a concrete implementation of *ConfigurationItemList*.

### Public Properties

#### *ItemList*
This property holds all items of the list. It is typically initialized in the implementation of *loadFromConfiguration*. You can read from and write to *ItemList*.

#### *CurrentItem*
The currently selected line in the list. You can read from and write to *CurrentItem*.

#### *ListHandle*
Returns the AutoHotkey HNDL for the *ListView* or *ListBox* used for this list widget.

### Public Methods

#### *initializeList(listHandle :: AutoHotkey HNDL, listVariable :: String, addButton :: String := false, deleteButton :: String := false, updateButton :: String := false, upButton :: String := false, downButton :: String := false)*
You call this method at the end of the *createGui* implementation to register your active controls of the list widget. The list widget supports optional "Add", "Delete" and "Save" buttons to control the associated editor area and also optional "Up" and "Down" buttons to control the position of an element in the list. The supplied arguments must be the names of the variables associated with the given control. Additionally, these buttons must have defined corrsponding *g-labels* for the AutoHotkey controls, that are named "addItem", "deleteItem", "updateItem", "upItem" and "downItem" correspondingly. See the documentation on the [AutoHotkey Gui coommand](https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/commands/Gui.htm) for more information. 

#### *associateList(variable :: String, itemList :: ConfigurationItemList)*
This method is called by *initializeList* for each of the supplied variables to register the item list with the given control. Later on, the list can be retrieved during a Gui event by calling *getList*.

#### *getList(variable :: String)*
Returns the instance of *ConfigurationItemList*, which had been associated with the given variable. Normally, there is no need to call this method from your code, since this is part of the event management protocol.

#### *clickEvent(line :: Integer, count :: Integer)*
This method is called, when an item is clicked more than once in the list. The default implementation calls method *openEditor*, which finally will call *loadEditor*.

#### *selectEvent(line :: Integer)*
This method is called, when an item is selected  in the list by using the cursor keys of the keyboard. The default implementation calls *openEditor*, which finally will call *loadEditor*.

#### *openEditor(itemNumber :: Integer)*
Opens and initializes the editor area for the selected item number. This method is part of the event protocol and there is no need to call it directly. *openEditor* finally calls *loadEditor*.

#### *selectItem(itemNumber)*
This method is also part of the event protocol and is called to select a new item in the list, for example after a nw item has been saved from the editor to the list and should be the newly selected item now.

#### *addItem()*, *deleteItem()*, *updateItem()*, *upItem()*, *downItem()*
These methods will be called, whenever one of the buttons, that had been initially registered by calling *initializeList*, are clicked by the user. No need to call them directly, as they are also part of the generic event protocol.

#### *updateState()*
This method is automatically called, whenever a state change occured. It must update all controls to reflect the current state. A state change is for example a new selecion in the list, an updated item in the editor, after the user saved the changes, and so on. The default implementation handles all controls, that had been registered by calling *initializeList*.

#### [Abstract] *loadList(items :: Array)*
This method must be implemented by the concrete subclass of *ConfigurationItemList* to load the given configuration items into the list view or list box.

#### [Abstract] *loadEditor(item :: Object)*
Is calle, whenever an item is selected in the list. The selected *item* is passed to this method and the implementation of this abstract method must initialize all controls from the given item object.

#### [Abstract} *clearEditor()*
Must be implemented by the concrete subclass of *ConfigurationItemList*. *clearEditor* will be called whenever there is no currently selected item in the list. All fields and controls in the editor area should be made empty or reset to their initial state.

#### [Abstract] *buildItemFromEditor(isNew :: Boolean := false)*
This method must also be implemented by the concrete subclass of *ConfigurationItemList*. It is called, whenever the current changes of the item in the editor area should be saved. The method must load the values from all controls and must construct an item of the required structure, which can be anything from a simple string up to a complex object, as long as the variable *iItemsList* and the methods *loadList*, *loadEditor* and *buildItemFromEditor* share the same understanding of this structure.

# Controller Classes

All the following classes are part of the Simulator Controller core framework defined in the [Simulator Controller.ahk](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/blob/main/Sources/Controller/Simulator%20Controller.ahk) script. In many cases they are based on one of the configuration classes above.

## [Singleton] SimulatorController extends [ConfigurationItem](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Classes-Reference#abstract-configurationitem-configurationahk) ([Simulator Controller.ahk](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/blob/main/Sources/Controller/Simulator%20Controller.ahk))
This class implements the core functionality of Simulator Controller. The single instance manages a set of plugins and the connection between hardware functions of a given controller and the actions implemented by these plugins.

### Public Properties

#### [Class] *Instance*
This class property returns the single instance of *SimulatorController*.

#### *Settings*
Returns the controller configuration map, not to be confused with the complete simulator configration map. This small configuration defines settings for controller notifications such as tray tips and visual representation for connected controller hardware like Button Boxes and is maintained by the [settings editor](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Using-Simulator-Controller#startup-process--settings).
	
#### *FunctionController[class :: Class := false]*
Returns a list all [FunctionController](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Classes-Reference#abstract-functioncontroller-extends-configurationitem-simulator-controllerahk) instances registered for the controller. These must have been created by a specialized plugin and registered in the controller by calling [registerFunctionController](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Classes-Reference#abstract-functioncontroller-extends-configurationitem-simulator-controllerahk). See [this simple example](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/blob/main/Sources/Plugins/ButtonBox%20Plugin.ahk) for an example. If the class parameter has been supplied, only instances of this given class will be returned.
	
#### *Functions*
Returns a list of all functions defined in the underlying configuration.
	
#### *Plugins*
Returns a list of all registered plugins. Some of these plugins might be inactive according to the configuration.
	
#### *Modes*
A list of all modes defined by all plugins. Here also, not all modes might be active in a given situation.
	
#### *ActiveModes*
The currently active modes. These modes define the currently active layer of controller functions and actions on your hardware controllers.

#### *ActiveMode[controller :: FunctionController}*
Returns the mode, which is currently active for the given controller argument. If more than one mode is active on this controller, only the first of these modes is returned.
	
#### *ActiveSimulator*
If a simulation game is currently running, the name of this application is returned by this property.
	
#### *LastEvent*
This property returns an integer representing the time of the last controller hardware event as reported by the special AutoHotkey variable [A_TickCount](https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/Variables.htm#TickCount).

#### *Started*
Is *true*, if the startup process of the controller is complete, *false* before. Before *Startup* is *true* no user interface will be available and the controller must not react to any event.

### Public Methods

#### *__New(simulatorConfiguration :: ConfigurationMap, settings :: ConfigurationMap)*
Constructs a new *SimulatorController* instance. Both configuration parameters are required. The first expects the general simulator configuration map (see [kSimulatorConfiguration](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Constants-Reference#global-configuration-map-constantsahk) for reference), the second is the small configuration map maintained by the [configuration tool](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Using-Simulator-Controller#startup-process--configuration) and stored in a configuration file referenced by [kSimulatorSettingsFile](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Constants-Reference#ksimulatorconfigurationfile-ksimulatorsettingsfile).
Since *SimulatorController* is a singleton class, the single instance might be accessed after construction by referencing *SimulatorController.Instance*.

#### [Factory Method] *createControllerFunction(descriptor :: String, configuration :: ConfigurationMap)*
Returns an instance of [ControllerFunction](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Classes-Reference#abstract-controllerfunction-simulator-controllerahk) according to the givven descriptor.

#### *findFunctionController(function :: ControllerFunction)*
Return the *FunctionController* instance, that defines the given function, or *false*, if the function is not associated with a hardware controller.

#### *findPlugin(name :: String)*
Searches for a plugin with the given name. Returns *false*, if not found.

#### *findMode(plugin :: TypeUnion(String, ControllerPlugin), name :: String)*
Searches for a mode with the given name for the given plugin, which might be passed as the name of the plugin in question. Returns *false*, if not found.

#### *findFunction(name :: String)*
Searches for a controller function with the given descriptor. Returns *false*, if not found.

#### *getActions(function :: ControllerFunction, trigger :: String)*
Returns the controller actions for the given function / trigger combination. Only currently active actions, which are bound to a function by their mode or plugin, are considered. Returns *false*, if there is no action currently connected to the function.

#### *registerFunctionController(controller :: FunctionController)*
Registers a visual representation for the hardware controller. This method is automatically called by the constructor of [FunctionController](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Classes-Reference#abstract-functioncontroller-extends-configurationitem-simulator-controllerahk).

#### *unregisterFunctionController(controller :: FunctionController)*
Removes a visual representation for the hardware controller from this controller. This method might be called from your own plugin to remove all predefined controller representations before registering your own ones.

#### *registerPlugin(plugin :: ControllerPlugin)*
Registers the given plugin for the controller. If the plugin is active, the *activate* method will be invoked, thereby allowing the plugin to register some actions for controller functions.

Note: Normally, this method is called by the constructor of the plugin. Therefore it is in many cases unnecessary to call *registerPlugin* directly. But depending on initialization order, where modes and actions have been defined after the basic instance construction, a second activation of the plugin might be necessary. All side effects of *registerPlugin* are idempotent, so you can call it as many times you like. 

#### *registerMode(plugin :: ControllerPlugin, mode :: ControllerMode)*
Registers the given mode of the given plugin for the controller.

Note: Normally, this method is called by the *registerMode* method of the plugin. Therefore it is almost always unnecessary to call *registerMode* for the controller directly. But, since all side effects of *registerMode* are idempotent, you can call it for your peace of mind as often as you like.

#### *isActive(modeOrPlugin :: TypeUnion(ControllerPlugin, ControllerMode))*
Returns *true*, if the given plugin or mode is active. Plugins may be deactivated according to configuration information, whereas modes may be deactivated based on a dynamic test, for example, whether a simulator is currently running.

#### *runningSimulator()*
Returns the name of the currently running simulation game or *false*, if no simulation is running.

#### *simulatorStartup(simulator :: String)*
This method is called when a simulation is starting up. The info is distributed to all registered plugins.

#### *simulatorShutdown(simulator :: String)*
This method is called when a simulation has terminated. The info is distributed to all registered plugins.

#### *startSimulator(application :: Application, splashImage :: String := false)*
Starts the simulator represented by the given application. The [startup](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Classes-Reference#startupspecial--boolean--true-wait--boolean--false-options--string--) method of *Application* will be called with *false* for the *special* parameter, so that *startSimulator* can be used by a special startup handler provided by plugins without creating an infinite recursion. If *splashImage* is supplied, the startup process will run verbose, showing a splash screen and a progress bar, and possibly playing a startup song. *splashImage* must either be a partial path for a JPG or GIF file relative to [kSplashMediaDirectory](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Constants-Reference#ksplashmediadirectory-kbuttonboximagesdirectory-kiconsdirectory), for example "Simulator Splash Images\ACC Splash.jpg", or a partial path relative to the *Simulator Controller\Splash Media* folder, which is located in the *Documents* folder of the current user, or an absolute path. *startSimulator* returns the process id of the application process.

#### *connectAction(plugin :: ControllerPlugin, function :: ControllerFunction, action :: ControllerAction)*
Connects a given action unambiguously to the given function. All future activation of the function by the controller hardware will trigger the given action. Normally, *connectAction* is called during [activation](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Classes-Reference#activate) of plugins and modes.

#### *disconnectAction(plugin :: ControllerPlugin, function :: ControllerFunction, action :: ControllerAction)*
Disconnects the given action from the given function. Normally, *disconnectAction* is called during [deactivation](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Classes-Reference#deactivate) of plugins and modes.

#### *fireActions(function :: ControllerFunction, trigger :: String)*
This is a dispatcher method, since in the end, the [fireAction](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Classes-Reference#abstract-fireactionfunction--controllerfunction-trigger--string) method of the corresponding actions is called. These actions are retrieved using [getActions](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Classes-Reference#getactionsfunction--controllerfunction-trigger--string).

#### *setMode(newMode :: ControllerMode)*
Switches the controller to a different mode. The currently active mode will be [deactivated](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Classes-Reference#deactivate) and the new mode will be [activated](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Classes-Reference#activate), thereby connecting all its actions to the correspondiing controller functions.

#### *setModes(simulator :: String := false, session :: String := false)*
This method is called, whenever a global state change occured in your simulation session. A state change might be the start or shutdown of a simulation game or you might enter a new session, for example a race, in your running simulation. The default implementation uses the rules, that have been defined in the [settings editor](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Using-Simulator-Controller#configuration-of-the-controller-mode-automation), to activate the modes on your controller hardware, which fit the current situation the most.

## [Abstract] ControllerFunction ([Simulator Controller.ahk](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/blob/main/Sources/Controller/Simulator%20Controller.ahk))
This is the root class of all controller functions used by the Simulator Controller framework. Due to restrictions in the AutoHotkey language (no multiple inheritance or multiple interface implementation capabilities), this class (and all of its subclasses) does not inherit from the configurable [Function](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Classes-Reference#abstract-function-extends-configurationitem-configurationahk) class. But the protocol of *Function* is completely implemented and *ControllerFunction* and all its descendants use some sort of delegation pattern to connect to the configuration information of *Function*.

### Public Properties

#### *Controller*
Returns the controller, for which this function has been defined.

#### *Function*
Returns the wrapped original class, an instance of [Function](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Classes-Reference#abstract-function-extends-configurationitem-configurationahk).

#### *Type*
Returns the [type constant](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Constants-Reference#controller-function-types-constantsahk) of the given function. This property must be implemented by a concrete subclass.
	
#### *Number*
Returns the running number of the controller function. For example Button # **3**...
	
#### *Descriptor*
The resource descriptor of the given function. Typically looks like "Button.3" or "Dial.2".

#### *Enabled[action :: ControllerAction := false]*
*true*, if the function can currently be triggered. If *action* is not supplied, the property will evaluate, if any of the actions might be triggered, otherwise the supplied action will be checked.

#### *Trigger*
Returns a list of all triggers available for this controller function. A button class might return ["Push"], beacause only this single functionality is provided, whereas a dial function might return ["Increase", "Decrease"].
	
#### *Hotkeys[trigger :: String := false]*
Returns all the hotkeys for all triggers handled by this controller function. Depending on the argument, this might be a map for all triggers or the result for one specific trigger. See the [original method](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Classes-Reference#hotkeystrigger--string--false-astext--boolean--false) in *Function* for more information.

#### *Actions[trigger :: String := false]*
Similar to the *Hotkeys* property, this property returns the defined actions. See the [original method](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Classes-Reference#actionstrigger--string--false-astext--boolean--false) in *Function* for more information. The actions returned here will be function objects, that in the end will activate the *fireAction* method of [ControllerAction](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Classes-Reference#controlleraction-simulator-controllerahk). 

### Public Methods

#### *__New(controller :: SimulatorController, function :: Function)*
Constructs an instance of *ControllerFunction*. The supplied *function* must be an instance of the wrapped class [Function](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Classes-Reference#abstract-function-extends-configurationitem-configurationahk), which provides the configuration information.

#### *enable(trigger :: String := false, action :: ControllerAction := false)*
Enables the given trigger (for example "Push") for this controller function, which means, that the connected action can be triggered by the hardware controller. If *trigger* is not supplied, all triggers will be enabled. If *action* is supplied, the function is enabled only for the given action.

#### *disable(trigger :: String := false, action :: ControllerAction := false)*
Disables the given trigger (for example "Push") for this controller function, which means, that the connected action cannot be triggered anymore by the hardware controller. If *trigger* is not supplied, all triggers will be disabled. If *action* is supplied, the function is disabled only for the given action.

#### *setLabel(text :: String, color :: String := "Black")*
If the controller has an associated visual representation of the hardware controller or if the controller supports graphical feedback on its own, the visual label of the function might be changed with this method. The given color must be a defined HTML color descriptor.

#### *setIcon(path :: String)*
If the controller has an associated visual representation of the hardware controller or if the controller supports graphical feedback on its own, the icon of the function might be changed with this method.

#### *connectAction(plugin :: ControllerPlugin, action :: ControllerAction)*
Connects or binds the function to the given action. From now on, every trigger of the hardware controller will result in an activation of the [fireAction](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Classes-Reference#abstract-fireactionfunction--controllerfunction-trigger--string) method of the action, as long as the function is currently enabled for the trigger in question. Normally, functions will be connected during the activation of plugins or modes.

#### *disconnectAction(plugin :: ControllerPlugin, action :: ControllerAction)*
Disconnects the function from the given action. Normally, functions will be disconnected during the deactivation of plugins or modes.

## ControllerTwoWayToggleFunction extends [ControllerFunction](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Classes-Reference#abstract-controllerfunction-simulator-controllerahk) ([Simulator Controller.ahk](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/blob/main/Sources/Controller/Simulator%20Controller.ahk))
Concrete implementation for two state toggle switches, like On/Off switches. The triggers returned by *Trigger* are ["On", "Off"].

***

## ControllerOneWayToggleFunction extends [ControllerFunction](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Classes-Reference#abstract-controllerfunction-simulator-controllerahk) ([Simulator Controller.ahk](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/blob/main/Sources/Controller/Simulator%20Controller.ahk))
Concrete implementation for single state switches, for example a momentary ignition switch. The triggers returned by *Trigger* are ["On"].

***

## ControllerButtonFunction extends [ControllerFunction](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Classes-Reference#abstract-controllerfunction-simulator-controllerahk) ([Simulator Controller.ahk](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/blob/main/Sources/Controller/Simulator%20Controller.ahk))
Concrete implementation for simple push buttons. The triggers returned by *Trigger* are ["Push"].

***

## ControllerDialFunction extends [ControllerFunction](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Classes-Reference#abstract-controllerfunction-simulator-controllerahk) ([Simulator Controller.ahk](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/blob/main/Sources/Controller/Simulator%20Controller.ahk))
Concrete implementation for rotary dials. The triggers returned by *Trigger* are ["Increase", "Decrease"] for the two different rotary directions.

***

## ControllerCustomFunction extends [ControllerFunction](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Classes-Reference#abstract-controllerfunction-simulator-controllerahk) ([Simulator Controller.ahk](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/blob/main/Sources/Controller/Simulator%20Controller.ahk))
Concrete implementation for custom or external function. The triggers returned by *Trigger* are ["Call"] for a generic activation of the function. Normally, custom functions are not bound to a hardware controller, but serve as an interface for other event sources, like a voice control software or a keyboard macro tool.

***

## ControllerPlugin extends [Plugin](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Classes-Reference#plugin-extends-configurationitem-configurationahk) ([Simulator Controller.ahk](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/blob/main/Sources/Controller/Simulator%20Controller.ahk))
This is the central class, that must be implemented to extend the functionality of the Simulator Controller. Tha base class [Plugin](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Classes-Reference#plugin-extends-configurationitem-configurationahk) provides all the configuration information, wherease *ControllerPlugin* defines the protocol to interact with the simulator controller and, most important, supplies [modes](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Classes-Reference#controllermode-simulator-controllerahk) and [actions](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Classes-Reference#controlleraction-simulator-controllerahk).

### Public Properties

#### *Controller* {
Returns the controller, where this plugin has been registered.
	
#### *Modes*
A list of all [modes](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Classes-Reference#controllermode-simulator-controllerahk) defined by this plugin.
	
#### *Actions*
A list of all actions defined by this plugin. Only the actions defined directly for the plugin will be returned, not including the actions defined by the modes of the plugin.

### Public Methods

#### *__New(controller :: SimulatorController, name :: String, configuration :: ConfigurationMap, register :: Boolean := true)*
Constructs an instance of *ControllerPlugin*. The first three parameters are required. If the optional parameter *register* is supplied and *false*, the plugin is not registered automatically in the *controller*. This might be necessary in complex initialization scenarios. You can register the plugin anytime later by calling *registerPlugin* manually.

#### *findMode(name :: String)*
Searches for a mode defined by this plugin with the given name. Returns *false*, if not found.

#### *findAction(label :: String)*
Searches for an action with the given name defined by this plugin. Returns *false*, if not found.

#### *registerMode(mode :: ControllerMode)*
Registers the given mode in the plugin.

Note: Normally, this method is called by the constructor method of the mode. Therefore it is almost always unnecessary to call *registerMode* for the plugin directly. But, since all side effects of *registerMode* are idempotent, you can call it for your peace of mind as often as you like.

#### *registerAction(action :: ControllerAction)*
Registers the given action in the plugin. In deviation from all other *register...* methods, *registerAction* is not called automatically by the constructor of [ControllerAction](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Classes-Reference#controlleraction-simulator-controllerahk), since actions may be defined both for plugins or for modes. Therefore you need to register a new action for the right owner object.

#### *isActive()*
Returns *true*, if the plugin is to be considered active. The default implementation is based on the [Active](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Classes-Reference#active) property of the base class and therefore adheres to the configuration.

#### *activate()*
This method is called by the controller, when the plugin needs to be activated. Normally, an active plugin gets activated in the moment, when it is registered in the controller. The default implementation connects all plugin actions to their respective functions.

#### *deactivate()*
This method is called by the controller, when the plugin needs to be deactivated. The default implemention of the controller never deactivates plugins, but a subclass may provide this functionality. The default implementation of *deactivate* disconnects all plugin actions from their respective functions.

#### *runningSimulator()*
Plugins, that have an understanding of simulation games and can detect their running state, may implement this method to return the name of a currently running simulation.

#### *simulatorStartup(simulator :: String)*
This is an event handler method called by the controller to notify the plugin, that a simulation just has been started. A plugin may, for example, switch to a specific mode specialized for the given simulator.

#### *simulatorShutdown(simulator :: String)*
This is an event handler method called by the controller to notify the plugin, that a simulation just has been stopped.

#### *getLabel(descriptor :: String, default :: String := false)*
This method can be used to support localization or using different labels depending on the bound function in the visual representation of the controller hardware. The label texts are defined in a special configuration file named *Controller Action Labels.XX* (where XX is a language code) located in the *Simulator Controller\Translations* folder in the users *Documents* folder. The content of this file is accessible using the [configuration tool](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Installation-&-Configuration#configuration).

#### *getIcon(descriptor :: String, default :: String := false)*
This method can be used to support localization or using different icons depending on the bound function in the visual representation of the controller hardware. The icon paths are defined in a special configuration file named *Controller Action Icons.XX* (where XX is a language code) located in the *Simulator Controller\Translations* folder in the users *Documents* folder. The content of this file is accessible using the [configuration tool](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Installation-&-Configuration#configuration).

#### *actionLabel(action :: ControllerAction)*
This method is called, whenever a label for the given action will be displayed on the visual representation of the controller hardware. The default implementation simply returns the *Label* property of the given action, but a subclass may add a translation process, for example.

#### *actionIcon(action :: ControllerAction)*
This method is called, whenever an icon for the given action will be displayed on the visual representation of the controller hardware. The default implementation simply returns the *Icon* property of the given action, but a subclass may implement dynamic icons, for example.

#### *logFunctionNotFound(functionDescriptor :: String)*
Helper method to log the most common configuration error: A function descriptor is referenced for an action, which is unknown, i.e. is not provided by the current hardware controller.
***

## ControllerMode ([Simulator Controller.ahk](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/blob/main/Sources/Controller/Simulator%20Controller.ahk))
Controller modes represent a layer or group of functionality for the hardware controller. All the actions, that are part of this group, will be defined by the mode. Only one mode may be active for the controller at any given point in time.
	
### Public Properties

#### [Abstract] *Mode*
Returns the name of the mode, wich might be displayed in the visual representation of the hardware controller, for example a Button Box. This property must be implemented by all subclasses.
	
#### *Plugin*
Returns the plugin, which has defined this mode.
	
#### *Controller*
The controller, where the plugin of this mode has been registered.

#### *FunctionController*
Returns a list all [FunctionController](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Classes-Reference#abstract-functioncontroller-extends-configurationitem-simulator-controllerahk) instances, on which this mode has registered actions.

#### *Actions*
A list of all actions defined by this mode.

### Public Methods
	
#### *__New(plugin :: ControllerPlugin)*
Constructs a new mode. [registerMode](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Classes-Reference#registermodemode--controllermode) is called for the given plugin.

#### *registerAction(action :: ControllerAction)*
Registers the given action for this mode. In deviation from some other *register...* methods, *registerAction* is not called automatically by the constructor of [ControllerAction](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Classes-Reference#controlleraction-simulator-controllerahk), since actions might be defined for plugins or for modes. Therefore you need to register a new action for the right owner object.

#### *registerFunctionController(controller :: FunctionController)*
Registers a visual representation for the hardware controller, for which this mode has defined one or more actions. This method is called automatically, so nothing to do on your side, but you may want to overwrite the method in situations, where you want to take special actions for one of these controller.

#### *findAction(label :: String)*
Searches for an action with the given label or name defined by this mode. Returns *false*, if not found.

#### *isActive()*
Return *true*, if this mode is currently active, which means, that it can be activated by the controller. The default implementation will check, whether the mode is dependent on a specific running simulator and will act accordingly.

#### *activate()*
This method is called by the controller, when the mode will be activated. The default implementation connects all mode actions to their respective functions.

#### *deactivate()*
This method is called by the controller, when the mode will be deactivated. The default implementation of *deactivate* disconnects all mode actions from their respective functions.

***

## ControllerAction ([Simulator Controller.ahk](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/blob/main/Sources/Controller/Simulator%20Controller.ahk))
This little class represents the actions, which can be connected to the hardware controller functions. An action simply consists of a label, which may be displayed on the visual representation of the controller hardware and the *fireAction* method, which implements the triggerable functionality.

### Public Properties

#### *Function*
Returns the function, to which this action will be connected, when the correspoding plugin or mode is active.
	
#### *Controller*
The controller, where the corresponding function has been registered.
	
#### *Label*
Returns the label of this action.
	
#### *Icon*
Returns the path to the icon file of this action, or *false*, if no special has been defined.
	
### Public Methods

#### *__New(function :: ControllerFunction, label :: String := "", icon :: String := false)*
Constructs an instance of *ControllerAction*.

#### *connectFunction(plugin :: ControllerPlugin, function :: ControllerFunction)*
Called, when this action has been bound to the given function. The default method does nothing. Normally, functions will be connected during the activation of plugins or modes.

#### *disconnectFunction(plugin :: ControllerPlugin, function :: ControllerFunction)*
Called, when this action has been disconnected from the given function. The default method does nothing. Normally, functions will be disconnected during the deactivation of plugins or modes.

#### [Abstract] *fireAction(function :: ControllerFunction, trigger :: String)*
This method must be implemented by every subclass of *ControllerAction* and act according to the supplied trigger argument.

***

## [Abstract] FunctionController extends [ConfigurationItem](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Classes-Reference#abstract-configurationitem-configurationahk) ([Simulator Controller.ahk](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/blob/main/Sources/Controller/Simulator%20Controller.ahk))
Instances of this class represent a given hardware controller. Subclasses of *FunctionController* must be implemented for each type of contrroller hardware (Button Boxes, Stream Decks, and so on), which will be supported by Simulator Controller.

### Public Properties

#### *Controller*
Returns the corresponding controller.

#### *Descriptor*
Returns a unique descriptor for this instance of *Function Controller*. The default implementation returns the name of the class, which will be unique in most cases, unless you have more than one controller of the same type.

#### *Type*
Returns a unique string representation for this instance of *Function Controller*, which may be used in configuration files, for example. The default implementation returns the value of the property *Descriptor*.
	
#### *Num1WayToggles*

#### *Num2WayToggles*
The number of 2-way toggle switches of the controller. This is maintained by the [configuration tool](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Installation-&-Configuration#configuration).

#### *NumButtons*
The number of simple push buttons of the controller. This is maintained by the [configuration tool](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Installation-&-Configuration#configuration).

#### *NumDials*
The number of rotary dials of the controller. This is maintained by the [configuration tool](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Installation-&-Configuration#configuration).

### Public Methods

#### *__New(controller :: SimulatorController, configuration :: ConfigurationMap := false)*
Constructs a new represenation for a controller hardware. The controller is automatically registered for the given controller using [registerFunctionController](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Classes-Reference#registerfunctioncontrollercontroller--functioncontroller).

#### *setControls(num1WayToggles :: Integer, num2WayToggles :: Integer, numButtons :: Integer, numDials :: Integer)*
Must be called by implementations of *FunctionController* to specifiy the type and number of controls, this controller provides in its layout.
	
#### [Abstract] *hasFunction(function :: ControllerFunction)*
This method must be implemented by a subclass of *FunctionController*. It must return *true*, if the given controller implements the given function.

#### *connectAction(plugin :: ControllerPlugin, function :: ControllerFunction, action :: ControllerAction)*
Called, when the given action has been bound to the given function. The default method does nothing, but an implementation in a subclass my show the label and icon of the given function on the controller hardware or on the corresponding visual representation.

#### *disconnectAction(plugin :: ControllerPlugin, function :: ControllerFunction, action :: ControllerAction)*
Called, when the given action has been disconnect from the given function. The default method does nothing, but an implementation in a subclass my clear the label and icon of the given function on the controller hardware or on the corresponding visual representation.

#### *setControlLabel(function :: ControllerFunction, text :: String, color :: String := "Black", overlay :: Boolean := false)*
This method is called to set the info text for the given function on the controller. Useful, if the given controller has a visual representation (see [GuiFunctionController](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Classes-Reference#abstract-guifunctioncontroller-extends-functioncontroller-simulator-controllerahk) for a subclass, which provides the necessary protocol).

## [Abstract] GuiFunctionController extends [FunctionController](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Classes-Reference#abstract-functioncontroller-extends-configurationitem-simulator-controllerahk) ([Simulator Controller.ahk](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/blob/main/Sources/Controller/Simulator%20Controller.ahk))
Although the Simulator Controller will provide complete functionality even without a visual representation for a given physical controller, it is much more fun to see what happens. Subclasses of *GuiFunctionController* may use the [Gui capabilities](https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/commands/Gui.htm) of the AutoHotkey language to implement the graphical representation. See [this implementation](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/blob/main/Sources/Plugins/ButtonBox%20Plugin.ahk), which implements configuration and grid based Button Boxes for reference.

### Public Properties

#### *Visible*
Returns *true*, if the controller window is currently visible.

#### *VisibleDuration*
The time in milliseconds, the controller may be visible after an action has been triggered. You can specify two different durations with the [configuration tool](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Installation-&-Configuration#configuration), depending being in a running simulation or not.

### Public Methods

#### *__New(controller :: SimulatorController, configuration :: ConfigurationMap := false)*
The constructor calls *createGui* automatically.
	
#### [Abstract] *createGui()*
This method must be implemented by a subclass of *FunctionController*. The window with its Gui controls for the visual representation of the controller must be created. The implementation of *createGui* must call *associateGui* (see below) and supply the Gui prefix for this window (see the [AutoHotkey documentation](https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/commands/Gui.htm) for an explanation), and its width and height and other information to the framework. Furthermore, all label fields must be registered using *registerControlHandle*.

#### *associateGui(window :: String, width :: Integer, height :: Integer, num1WayToggles :: Integer, num2WayToggles :: Integer, numButtons :: Integer, numDials :: Integer)*
This method must be called by *createGui* to describe the controller to the framework.

#### *findFunctionController(window :: String)*
This class method return the *FunctionController* instance, that defined the given window, or *false*, if there is no such instance.

#### *registerControlHandle(descriptor :: String, handle :: Control Handle)*
This method must be called by *createGui* as well for each label field of the controller. *handle* must be a control handle as defined by the *Hwnd* argument of [AutoHotkey Gui elements](https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/commands/Gui.htm).

#### *getControlHandle(descriptor :: String)*
For each visual representation of a controller function, which will a have an associated label or text field, a [GuiControl handle](https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/commands/GuiControl.htm) will be returned, or *false*, if there is no such text control. The given descriptor will identify the function according to the standard descriptor format, like "Button.3".
	
#### *show()*
Shows the controller window according to the visibility rules defined in the configuration. This method is called automatically by the framework after each potential visual change.

#### *hide()*
Hides the controller window again. This method is automatically called, after the visible duration defined in the configuration has elapsed with no hardware trigger event in between.

#### *moveByMouse(button :: String := "LButton")*
Call this method from an event handler. It will move the controller window following the mouse, while the given button is down. The position will be remembered as the "Last Position" in the *Simulator Controller.ini* configuration file.

***

# Simulator Plugin Implementation Classes

The two classes *SimulatorPlugin* and *RaceAssistantSimlatorPlugin* can be used as building blocks, when implementing a plugin for a race simulation game. Since these classes are placed in a special library file, you must include the following line at the top of your plugin script:

	#Include ..\Plugins\Libraries\SimulatorPlugin.ahk

You can take a look at a specific implementation of a simulator plugin for an example on how to use these building blocks (for example [AC Plugin.ahk](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/blob/main/Sources/Plugins/AC%20Plugin.ahk) with minimal support or [RF2 Plugin.ahk](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/blob/main/Sources/Plugins/RF2%20Plugin.ahk) with full support including the AI Race Engineer and pitstop handling).

## SimulatorPlugin extends [ControllerPlugin](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Classes-Reference#controllerplugin-extends-plugin-simulator-controllerahk) ([SimulatorPlugin.ahk](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/blob/main/Sources/Plugins/Libraries/SimulatorPlugin.ahk))
This class may be used for simple simulator plugins which will NOT support the AI Race Engineer. The implementation *understands* that a given applicaton represents the simulator game and also is able to separate between different session types ("Practice", "Race", and so on). Depending on the technical capabilities and the supplied initialization arguements, a "Pitstop" mode (see class [PitstopMode](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Classes-Reference#pitstopmode-extends-controllermode-simulatorpluginahk)) is created upon initialization.

### Public Properties

#### *Code*
This property returns a three letter short name for the plugin, which is used as a descriminator in several functions of Simulator Controller. The default implementation simply returns the name of the plugin (for example "AC", "ACC", "RF2", ...).

#### *CommandMode[}*
Returns the event mode used to communicate with the simulation game. Returns one of "Event", "Input", "Play" or "Raw".

#### *CommandDelay[}*
Returns the delay in ms, which is used between each command send to the simulation game.

#### *Simulator[name :: Boolean := false]*
The *Application* object representing the simulation game. If you supply *true* for *name* the actual name of the simulator is returned.

#### *Car*
The name of the car, if the player is currently on the track.

#### *Track*
The name of the track, if the player is currently on the track.

#### *SessionState[asText :: Boolean := false]*
The current seesion state of an active simulation. Will be one of [kSessionFinished, kSessionPaused, kSessionOther, kSessionPractice, kSessionQualification or kSessionRace](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Constants-Reference#simulation-session-types-simulatorpluginahk) or a corresponding textual representation, when *true* has been supplied for the optional parameter *asText*.

#### *SessionStates[asText :: Boolean := false]*
A list of all supported session states supported by the given simulator (excluding *kSessionFinished* and *kSessionPaused*, which must be supported by everey simulator plugin). Therefore one of [kSessionOther, kSessionPractice, kSessionQualification or kSessionRace](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Constants-Reference#simulation-session-types-simulatorpluginahk) or a corresponding textual representation, when *true* has been supplied for the optional parameter *asText*.

### Public Methods

#### *__New(controller :: SimulatorController, name :: String, simulator :: String, configuration :: ConfigurationMap, register :: Boolean := true)*
The constructor adds the additional parameter *simulator* to the inherited *__New* method. The name of the game application, as configured in the [configuration tool](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Using-Simulator-Controller#startup-process--configuration), must be supplied for the *simulator* parameter.

#### *createPitstopAction(controller :: SimulatorController, action :: String, increaseFunction :: String, #rest moreArguments :: String)*
This factory method will be called for each supplied action identifier for the [*pitstopCommands* plugin parameter](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Plugins-&-Modes#configuration-4). Please see the documentation of [getPitstopActions] for more information. Depending on the concrete action, *moreArguments* may contain a second controller function descriptor, an initial state and other information, like the number of increments a value should be changed by the action.

#### *getPitstopActions(ByRef allActions :: Map(String => String), ByRef selectActions :: Array)*
Whenever a simulator plugin can provide functionality to handle the pitstop settings automatically, this method must be overriden. All methods below (*openPitstopMFD*, *selectPitstopOption*, and so on) will only be called, if at least one pitstop action has been defined and initialized by a value for the plugin [*pitstopCommands* parameter](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Plugins-&-Modes#configuration-4). The first result parameter *allActions* must map all external action identifier used by *pitstopCommands* to internal option identifiers, which are used internally and may be shared with external code (for example, a telemetry plugin for the corresponding simulation game). Example: *TyreFrontLeft* => *FL PRESS:* (for *rFactor 2*). For each provided action, an instance of one of the subclasses of [PitstopAction](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Classes-Reference#abstract-pitstopaction-extends-controlleraction-simulatorpluginahk) is created and registered for the ["Pitstop" mode](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Classes-Reference#pitstopmode-extends-controllermode-simulatorpluginahk), which is also created automatically. In *selectActions* a list of all action identifiers, for which an instance of [PitstopSelectAction](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Classes-Reference#pitstopselectaction-extends-pitstopchangeaction-simulatorpluginahk) should be created, when only one controller function has been provided, for all other actions with one supplied controller functions, an instance of [PitstopToggleAction](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Classes-Reference#pitstoptoggleaction-extends-pitstopaction-simulatorpluginahk) will be created. When two controller functions has been supplied, two instances of [PitstopChangeAction](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Classes-Reference#pitstopchangeaction-extends-pitstopaction-simulatorpluginahk) will be created.

#### *activateWindow()*

#### [Abstract] *openPitstopMFD()*
The implementation of *openPitstopMFD*, which must be provided by a subclass, must open the pitstop settings dialog in order to automatically apply the necessary value changes using the methods below. *openPitstopMFD* must return *true*, when the pitstop settings dialog has been opened successfully.

#### *resetPitstopMFD()*
This method is called, when the user may have changed pitstop settings by its own. It marks the Pitstop MFD state as dirty, so to say. The default method does nothing.

#### [Abstract] *closePitstopMFD()*
This method, which also must be implemented by a subclass, must close the pitstop settings dialog.
	
#### [Abstract] *requirePitstopMFD()*
*requirePitstopMFD* is always called, before a value in the pitstop settings will be changed. It should check, if the pitstop settings dialog is already open and, if not, open it using *openPitstopMFD*. *requirePitstopMFD* returns *true*, if this requirement has been met, The standard implementation returns *false*.

#### [Abstract] *selectPitstopOption(option :: String)*
Is called when a setting on a Pitstop MFD is about to be changed. The implementation may move the input focus to the corresponding input widget, if necessary. *option* is the internal name of the pitstop setting to be changed (see [*getPitstopActions*](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Classes-Reference#getpitstopactionsbyref-allactions--mapstring--string-byref-selectactions--array) for discussion on internal vs. external pitstop command names). Returns *true*, if the option has been selected successfully, This method must be implemented by a subclass.
	
#### [Abstract] *changePitstopOption(option :: String, action :: String, steps :: Integer := 1) {
This method is called always directly after *selectPitstopOption* to change the value of a pitstop setting. *option* is the internal name of the pitstop setting to be changed (see [*getPitstopActions*](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Classes-Reference#getpitstopactionsbyref-allactions--mapstring--string-byref-selectactions--array) for discussion on internal vs. external pitstop command names). *direction* will be either "Increase" or "Decrease" and *steps* denote the number of value increments to be applied. This method must be implemented by a subclass.

#### *updateSessionState(sessionState :: OneOf(kSessionFinished, kSessionPaused, kSessionOther, ...))*
This method will be called, when a simulator has been started or finished, or when the user enters a simulation session. The default implementation informs the *SimulatorController* instance, which then will activate the best fitting modes on the controller hardware.

## RaceAssistantSimulatorPlugin extends [SimulatorPlugin](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Classes-Reference#simulatorplugin-extends-controllerplugin-simulatorpluginahk) ([SimulatorPlugin.ahk](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/blob/main/Sources/Plugins/Libraries/SimulatorPlugin.ahk))
*RaceAssistantSimulatorPlugin* extends the *SimulatorPlugin* class and adds support for Jona, the AI Race Engineer. Jona will be started automatically, whenever the underlying simulator game is running.

### Public Properties

#### *RaceEngineer*
Returns the instance of *RaceEngineerPlugin* (see the [documentation](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Plugins-&-Modes#plugin-race-engineer) of this plugin or the source code [Race Engineer Plugin.ahk](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/blob/main/Sources/Plugins/Race%20Engineer%20Plugin.ahk) for more information), as long, as the simulation is running.

#### *RaceStrategist*

### Public Methods

#### *createRaceAssistantAction(controller :: SimulatorController, action :: String, actionFunction :: String)*
Very similar to the [createPitstopAction](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Classes-Reference#createpitstopactioncontroller--simulatorcontroller-action--string-increasefunction--string-morearguments--string) factory method, this method is called for the *PitstopPlan* and *PitstopPrepare* actions. An instance of [RaceAssistantAction](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Classes-Reference#raceassistantaction-extends-controlleraction-simulatorpluginahk) will be created for each action and will be registered for the "Pitstop" mode.

#### *planPitstop()*
Calling this method will ask Jona to plan an upcoming pitstop.

#### *preparePitstop()*
Calling this method will ask Jona to prepare the last planned pitstop.

#### *supportsSpotter()*
If this method returns *true*, this plugin supports a spotter protocol together with the AI Race Spotter. The default implementation returns *true*, if a "xxx SHM Spotter.exe" exists in the *Binaries* folder, where xxx is equal to the plugin identifier. If the protocol uses a different data acquisition method rather than the shared memory reader process, an extension must be made to the implementation of the AI Race Spotter as well.

#### *supportsPitstop()*
If this method returns *true*, this plugin supports automated pitstop handling together with the AI Race Engineer. The default implementation returns *false*. Whenever a subclass of *RaceAssistantSimulatorPlugin* returns *true* here, it will implement at least some of the following methods as well.

#### *supportsSetupImport()*
If this method returns *true*, this plugin supports loading setup information from the underlying simulation. The default implementation returns *false*. Whenever a subclass of *RaceAssistantSimulatorPlugin* returns *true* here, the telemetry provider must implement the "-Setup" protocol.

#### *pitstopPlanned(pitstopNumber :: Integer, plannedLap :: Integer := false)*
*pitstopPlanned* is called by the Race Engineer, whenever there is an updated plan for an upcoming pitstop. If the pitstop is planned for a specific lap, the lap number is supplied as the second argument. The default method does nothing here.

#### *pitstopPrepared(pitstopNumber :: Integer)*
*pitstopPrepared* is called by the Race Engineer, whenever the pitstop plan has been sucessfully transferred to the simulation game and the driver may enter the pit. The default method does nothing here.

#### *pitstopFinished(pitstopNumber :: Integer)*
After the pitstop has been sucessfully carried out and the driver is back on the track, this method is called. The default method does nothing here.

#### *startPitstopSetup(pitstopNumber :: Integer)*
Called at the beginning of the pitstop preparation process, this method might activated the pitstop data input widget on the simulation user interface for example or might call a special API, to tell the simulation, that a pitstop is requested. The default method handles internal state change.

#### *finishPitstopSetup(pitstopNumber :: Integer)*
Called at the end of the pitstop preparation process. The implementation might close a special pitstop widget on the simulator user interface, when this has been opened by *startPitstopSetup*. The default method handles internal state change.

#### *setPitstopRefuelAmount(pitstopNumber :: Integer, liters :: Float)*
The implemenzation of *setPitstopRefuelAmount* must ask the simulation to refuel the given number of liters at the next pitstop. The default method handles internal state change.

#### *setPitstopTyreCompound(pitstopNumber :: Integer, compound :: OneOf("Dry", "Wet", ..., *false*), compoundColor :: OneOf("Red", "White", "Blue", "Black", ..., *false*) := false, set :: Integer := false)*
Requests new tyres at the given pitstop. *compound* will define the tyre category and *compoundColor* the compound mixture, wich will always be "Black" for "Wet" tyres. If a specific tyre set is requested, this will be passed for the last optional parameter. If *false* has been passed for *compound*, this means that no tyre change is requested. Both *compoundColor* and *set* will be ommitted in this case. The default method handles internal state change.

#### *setPitstopTyrePressures(pitstopNumber :: Integer, pressureFL :: Float, pressureFR :: Float, pressureRL :: Float, pressureRR :: Float)*
Dials the pressures in PSI, that has been selected previously by *setPitstopTyreCompound*. The default method handles internal state change.

#### *requestPitstopRepairs(pitstopNumber :: Integer, repairSuspension :: Boolean, repairBodywork :: Boolean, repairEngine :: Boolean := false)*
This method requests repairs for the different parts of the car at the pitstop. The default method handles internal state change.

#### *requestPitstopDriver(pitstopNumber :: Integer, driver :: String)*
This is the last method of the pitstop preparation cycle. It requests the next driver when swapping drivers in a team race. The default method handles internal state change.

#### *updatePositionsData(data :: ConfigurationMap)*
*updatePositionsData* is called after the [telemetry data](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/AI-Race-Engineer#telemetry-integration) has been loaded from the given simulation, but before the data is transferred to the AI Race Strategist. The implementation of *updatePositionsData* must add the position and timing information for all cars to the data object. See the documentation for the AI Race Strategist for more information about a [description of the corrsponding data fields](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/AI-Race-Strategist#data-acquisition).

#### *updateSessionData(data :: ConfigurationMap)*
*updateSessionData* is called after the [telemetry data](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/AI-Race-Engineer#telemetry-integration) has been loaded from the given simulation, but before the data is transferred to the AI Race Engineer. The implementation of *updateSessionData* might add some additional fields or change fields that has been provided by the simulation. See the [implementation of the *RaceRoom Racing Experience*](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/blob/main/Sources/Plugins/R3E%20Plugin.ahk) simulation for an example, where the name of the current car is read from an external JSON database file.

## PitstopMode extends [ControllerMode](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Classes-Reference#controllermode-simulator-controllerahk) ([SimulatorPlugin.ahk](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/blob/main/Sources/Plugins/Libraries/SimulatorPlugin.ahk))
This special controller mode is created automatically by the *SimulatorPlugin* whenever a pitstop action has been configured for the plugin.

### Public Methods

#### *updatePitstopActions(sessionState :: OneOf(kSessionFinished, kSessionPaused, kSessionOther, kSessionPractice, kSessionQualification, kSessionRace))*
This is called whenever the session state changes. The availability of all pitstop actions will be updated according to the new session state. The standard implementation enables the actions, whenever you are in a race or practice session.

#### *updateRaceAssistantActions(sessionState:: OneOf(kSessionFinished, kSessionPaused, kSessionOther, kSessionPractice, kSessionQualification, kSessionRace))*
This is called whenever the session state changes. The availability of the Race Engineer actions "PitstopPlan" and "PitstopPrepare* will be updated according to the new session state. The standard implementation enables the actions, whenever you are in a race session and the AI Race Strategist is running.

## [Abstract] PitstopAction extends [ControllerAction](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Classes-Reference#controlleraction-simulator-controllerahk) ([SimulatorPlugin.ahk](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/blob/main/Sources/Plugins/Libraries/SimulatorPlugin.ahk))
The base class of all pitstop actions.

### Public Properties

#### *Plugin*
The plugin, that created and owns this action.

#### *Option*
The option identifier for the corresponding pitstop setting. See [getPitstopActions](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Classes-Reference#getpitstopactionsbyref-allactions--mapstring--string-byref-selectactions--array) for an explanation of option identifiers.

#### *Steps*
The number of steps or incerements, the corresponding pitstop setting will be changed when the action fires.

### Public Methods

#### *__New(plugin :: SimulatorPlugin, function :: String, label :: String, option :: String, steps :: Integer := 1)*
The constructor adds the additional parameters *plugin*, *option* and *steps* to the inherited *__New* method, which are used to initialize the corresponding properties.

#### *fireAction(function :: ControllerFunction, trigger :: String)*
You must make sure, that all subclasses of *PitstopAction* call the base *fireAction* method before their own implementation, since the base *fireAction* method assures that the pitstop settings dialog is available and that the pitstop option is already selected by calling *requirePitstopMFD* and *selectPitstopOption* accordingly. *fireAction* then returns *true*, if the requirements for changing a pitstop setting are met.

	fireAction(function, trigger) {
		local plugin := this.Plugin
		
		return (plugin.requirePitstopMFD() && plugin.selectPitstopOption(this.Option))
	}

## PitstopChangeAction extends [PitstopAction](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Classes-Reference#abstract-pitstopaction-extends-controlleraction-simulatorpluginahk) ([SimulatorPlugin.ahk](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/blob/main/Sources/Plugins/Libraries/SimulatorPlugin.ahk))
A *PitstopChangeAction* changes the corresponding pitstop option always in the same direction. May be used for simple buttons on your controller hardware, for example to increase the amount of fuel to add at the next pitstop.

### Public Methods

#### *__New(plugin :: SimulatorPlugin, function :: String, label :: String, option :: String, direction :: OneOf("Increase", "Decrease"), steps :: Integer := 1)*
Adds the *direction* parameter, which must be either "Increase" or "Decrease". This value  is used in the implementation of *fireAction* to change the corresponding pitstop setting.

	fireAction(function, trigger) {
		if base.fireAction(function, trigger)
			this.Plugin.changePitstopOption(this.Option, this.Direction, this.Steps)
	}

## PitstopSelectAction extends [PitstopChangeAction](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Classes-Reference#pitstopchangeaction-extends-pitstopaction-simulatorpluginahk) ([SimulatorPlugin.ahk](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/blob/main/Sources/Plugins/Libraries/SimulatorPlugin.ahk))
A *PitstopSelectAction* is a specialized *PitstopChangeAction*, which changes the corresponding pitstop option always to the next value, which means that the *direction* will allways be "Increase".

### Public Methods

#### *__New(plugin, function, label, option, steps := 1)*
Removes the *direction* parameter from the inherited constructor, which defaults to "Increase".

## PitstopToggleAction extends [PitstopAction](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Classes-Reference#abstract-pitstopaction-extends-controlleraction-simulatorpluginahk) ([SimulatorPlugin.ahk](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/blob/main/Sources/Plugins/Libraries/SimulatorPlugin.ahk))
Used when the configured controller function is binary, for example a toggle switch or a dial. Therefore the corresponding pitstop setting can be incremented ("Increase") or decremented ("Decrease").

## RaceAssistantAction extends [ControllerAction](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Classes-Reference#controlleraction-simulator-controllerahk) ([SimulatorPlugin.ahk](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/blob/main/Sources/Plugins/Libraries/SimulatorPlugin.ahk))
Used for the *PitstopPlan* and *PitstopPrepare* pitstop actions. The implementation of *fireAction* simply calls the [planPitstop](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Classes-Reference#planpitstop) or [preparePitstop](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Classes-Reference#preparepitstop) methods of the simulator plugin, when the AI Race Engineer is running.

### Public Properties

#### *Plugin*
The plugin, that created and owns this action.

#### *Action*
Either "PitstopPlan" or "PitstopPrepare".

### Public Methods

#### *__New(plugin :: SimulatorPlugin, function :: String, label :: String, icon :: String, action :: OneOf("PitstopPlan", "PitstopPrepare"))*
The constructor adds the additional parameters *plugin* and *action* to the inherited *__New* method, which are used to initialize the corresponding properties.
