# Latest stable release

## 6.3.7.0

#### Date: 06/20/25

#### Fixes

  - Fixed a critical bug with pitstop history building for the Strategist, which could cause wrong strategy decisions.
  - Fixed some rare problems with outdated or incomplete configuration information when using the voice recognition test mode in "Simulator Setup".
  - Fixed a bug in the strategy handling for the Strategist, that prevented using a strategy with restricted tyre sets, if the simulator actually provides no information about tyre sets in the API. Mostly affected iRacing.

#### Changes

  - The Race Engineer now can handle brake pad changes during pitstop.
    - A brake change will be automatically planned in solo races, if a high brake pad wear had been detected and reported before.
	- The upcoming change of brake pads will be announced by the Engineer, when he informs about the pitstop plan.
	- The Engineer will also react to [changes made using the in-game Pitstop MFD settings](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/AI-Race-Engineer#the-pitstop), once a pitstop has been prepared (in ACC and Le Mans Ultimate).
	- Several new [settings](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Session-Settings) let you specify, whether the Engineer will provide brake service at all and how long a brake service will take at a pitstop (default is 50 seconds).
	- Brake pad changes can be controlled from the "Team Center" when [planning a pitstop](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Team-Center#planning-a-pitstop).
	- Information about executed brake pad changes has been added to various reports in the "Team Center".
	- Information about planned brake changes are shown on the pitstop information widget in the "System Monitor".
	- [Developer] Also, the same information is available in the ["Session State.json"](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Plugins-&-Modes#plugin-integration) file.
  - The driver for the next stint can now be selected in *Le Mans Ultimate*, as long as the corresponding setting is available in the Pitstop MFD.
    - This has not been tested, because no LMU servers with team support are yet available.
    - Supported in the "Team Center" pitstop planning tab. Make sure that the order of the drivers set in the entry list of the "Team Center" is identical to the order of the drivers as they appear in the in-game Pitstop MFD.
	- Also supported by using the repective controller action of the ["LMU" plugin](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Plugins-&-Modes#plugin-lmu).
	- The Engineer recognizes the manual [change of the next driver in the in-game Pitstop MFD settings](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/AI-Race-Engineer#the-pitstop), once a pitstop has been prepared.
  - The selected driver for the next stint will now be shown on the pitstop information widget in the "System Monitor".
  - [Developer] The same information is also available in the ["Session State.json"](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Plugins-&-Modes#plugin-integration) file.
  - [Developer] General expressions, that even can produce side effects, are now allowed in the [conditions](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Rule-Engine#conditions) and also in the [actions](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Rule-Engine#actions) of production rules.

# Upcoming release

## 6.3.8.0

#### Date: 06/27/25 (planned)

#### Fixes

  - Fixed multiple bugs in traffic simulation for pitstop prediction.
  - Fixed a critical bug in "Solo Center", which prevented loading of sessions created in *rFactor 2*.

#### Changes

  - Information about the last pitstop of each opponent is now available in the knowledge that is passed to an LLM for the Strategist.
  - The default for the large language model of OpenAI has changed to "GPT 4.1 mini". You may want to review your model configuration as well, because "GPT 4o mini" will get deprecated soon.
  - The Engineer now observes virtual energy consumption in addition to fuel consumption when running *le Mans Ultimate*, and will warn you, if the available virtual energy will be depleted soon.
    - Information about the available virtual energy and also energy consumption is displayed in the "Fuel" widget in the "System Monitor".
	- [Developer] The same information is also available in the ["Session State.json"](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Plugins-&-Modes#plugin-integration) file.
	- A new [event and a new action](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Customizing-Assistants#race-engineer) have been defined for the *Reasoning* booster of the Race Engineer, which allows a connected LLM to handle low energy conditions. Revisit your event and action configuration, if you have configured a *Reasoning* booster and include the new event and the new action, if necessary.
  - [Expert] The controller action function [*execute*](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Installation-&-Configuration#actions) can now handle arguments which are then passed to the external application or script.
  - [Developer] All fuel releated fields in the "Session State.json" file have changed their name to be aligned with the new energy related fields. The old fields are still available for compatibility reasons.

Please also take a look at the [Update Notes](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Update-Notes#release-638), especially if you have configured a *Reasoning* booster for the Race Engineer.

#### Date: 06/13/25

#### Fixes

  - Fixed a wrong download mirror reference when checking for available updates.
  - Fixed cold pressure calculation after a partial tyre change at the last pitstop.
  - Fixed a timeout when checking for news, which caused a very slow startup of "Simulator Startup".
  - The system no longer complains with an error dialog, if the hotkey for closing the Pitstop MFD is not defined.
  - Fixed the import of the initial setup at the start of the session. Was broken with the last release.
  - Fixed a couple of minor problems with regards to pitstop tyre data display in "Team Center", which were introduced with the new tyre compound handling for individual wheels.
  - Fixed an unhandled exception in the voice recognition test mode which prevents a normal interaction with the Driving Coach.
  - Fixed importing the currently mounted tyre compound into "Solo Center" by using the copy button.
  - Fixed many glitches and incompatibilities with the new version of the *Le Mans Ultimate* API, which was changed without notice with their last release.
  - Fixed language selection in the *Plugin Actions & Labels* editor.
  - Fixed dozens of minor bugs that was documented in the supplied log files via diagnostics upload.

#### Changes

  - More internal updates for wheel specific data handling. All applications now differentiate between driven laps for each tyre individually.
  - The data acquisition for *Le Mans Ultimate* now includes information about brake wear.
  - Tyre wear and also brake wear are now displayed in the lap reports of "Solo Center" and "Team Center", if that data is available.
  - The driver name is now passed for each car to the LLM, so that you can get information about your opponents by name (by @alejandrocq). 
  - The Engineer now observes the tyre wear and also the wear of the brake pads (if available in the data supplied by the simulator) and warns you, if the available tread or brake pad thickness falls below a given threshold.
    - A new [setting](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Session-Settings) in the "Session Database" lets you define the minimum available tyre tread, before a wear warning is issued.
	- Also, a new [setting](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Session-Settings) in the "Session Database" lets you define the minimum available brake pad thickness, before a wear warning is issued.
	- Two new [settings](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Session-Settings) let you specify, whether the Engineer will ask for confirmation to plan a pitstop, after excessive tyre or brake pad wear had been detected. This is also part of the so called "Autonomous" mode.
	- Additionally, a couple of new [settings](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Session-Settings) let you define in the "Session Database", in what sessions these warnings will be given. Reasonable defaults are already chosen, of course.
	- New [events and actions](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Customizing-Assistants#race-engineer) for the *Reasoning* booster have been defined, which allows a connected LLM to handle the tyre wear and brake wear accordingly. Revisit your event and action configuration, if you have configured a *Reasoning* booster and include the new events and actions, if necessary.
	
	Please note, that brake pad changes are not (yet) handled automatically by the Race Engineer.
  - A new [setting](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Session-Settings) in the "Session Database" lets you specify the number of laps before the end of the race, for which the Engineer does not consider pitstop services like tyre change, brake pad change and so on anymore.
  - The [documentation](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/AI-Race-Engineer#the-pitstop) for the Race Engineer capabilities for pitstop planning and preparation has been extended to cover all the latest additions.
  - Added car meta data for the new Pack 5 cars for *Le Mans Ultimate*.
  - Pausing the game is now detected for *Le Mans Ultimate*.
  - Support for setting handlers with negative step values has been added to "Setup Workbench". This is used for the damper settings for the Lamborghini Huracan in *Le Mans Ultimate*.
  - New car models for "Setup Workbench":
    - Le Mans Ultimate
	  - Lamborghini Huracán LMGT3 Evo2
      - Lexus RC F LMGT3

Please also take a look at the [Update Notes](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Update-Notes#release-636), if you have configured a *Reasoning* booster for the Race Engineer.

## 6.3.5.0

#### Date: 06/06/25

#### Fixes

  - A bug has been fixed in the strategy-based pitstop handling, which caused the wrong tyre compound to be chosen.
  - Fixed a bug, that caused an emergency pitstop to be planned for lap, that was actually in the "past".
  - Fixed the handling of tyre compounds in the strategy validation scripts, which has been broken with the introduction of multiple tyre compounds in one of the last releases.
  - Fixed several type conversion problems between *Lua* scripts and the host process, which caused especially floating point values to be coerced to integer values.
  - Fixed a bug that prevented on-track strategy simulation for sessions with undefined tyre sets.
  - Fixed a bug in "Simulator Setup", which prevented alternative download mirrors to be used for DLCs.
  - Fixed updating of recent lap telemetry data in "Solo Center". This bug resulted in unavailable tyre pressure and temperatur data for laps shortly after a pitstop.

#### Changes

  - The "Laps" data entries in the session database can now handle wheel specific information about the number of driven laps on the mounted tyre. You will find now four different tyre laps properties in the data reports in the "Strategy Workbench", "Solo Center" and "Team Center" applications, one for each wheel. Data points are still uniform for all four wheels with this release, but this will change with the next release.
  - Consent can now be given in the [personal profile dialog](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Using-Simulator-Controller#managing-your-privacy) to share anonymous data from your sessions that will be used to train models for the Assistants AI. The default for this setting is "No", so make sure, that you change it, if you want to contribute.
  - [Expert] When [defining the meta data for a new car](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Setup-Workbench#introducing-a-new-car) in the "Setup Workbench", [Lua](https://lua.org/) scripts can now be used to create handlers for complex settings in the setup, which cannot be defined correctly by using one of the predefined handlers.

## 6.3.4.0

#### Date: 05/30/25

#### Fixes

  - Fixed the preparation of the available tyre sets for the LLM by the Race Strategist in case of multiple tyre compounds mounted on the car.
  - Fixed a crash in "Race Reports", "Solo Center" and "Team Center", if an already retired car is reported by the simulator API.
  - Fixed the handling of explicit tyre sets by Race Engineer as configured in "Race Settings", which has been broken with the last release.
  - Fixed handling of database tyre pressures for upcoming pitstop by the Race Engineer, which has been broken with the last release.

#### Changes

  - [Important] The handling of the pitstop settings has changed for *rFactor 2*. It is now required to have the hotkeys for opening and closing the Pitstop MFD to be defined. This is necessary, because settings are not changed correctly, if the Pitstop MFD is not open while the change happens.
  - A [new setting](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Session-Settings) in the "Session Database" lets you define the minimum speed for the Race Spotter to be active. This useful, for example, to let the Spotter shut up during FCY phases. Default for "Spotter: Activation Speed" is 60 km/h.
  - Information about the current tyre wear is now supported for *Le Mans Ultimate*.
  - Support for executing *Lua* scripts has been added to the ["execute"](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Installation-&-Configuration#actions) controller action function. The scripts are executed in the "Simulator Controller" process and have access to the simulator and session state.
  - Multiple tyre compounds will be shown in the "Race Reports", if they have been used on the car.
  - "Race Settings" now support multiple tyre compounds for the initial car setup, if supported by the current simulator. See the [updated documentation](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/AI-Race-Engineer#tab-session) for additional remarks.
  - The detection of the currently active simulator has been improved for "Race Settings".
  - Multiple tyre compounds are now also stored in "Laps" entries in the session database. This is a preparation for multiple tyre compound support in strategies.

## 6.3.3.0

#### Date: 05/23/25

#### Fixes

  - Fixed a critical bug for the Race Strategist and the Race Engineer, that prevented the internal knowledge to be passed to the LLM, which prevented the LLM to answer any questions about the current session. Bug was introduced with the last release.
  - Fixed pitstop refueling for *rFactor 2* in case of non-linear fuel settings.
  - Fixed off by one error in the target lap of strategy controlled pitstops.
  - Fixed loading of lap-based strategies.
  - Fixed several bugs for axle-based tyre compound handling (used in *rFactor 2* and *RaceRoom Racing Experience*), which prevented session data to be shown in the "System Monitor".
  - Fixed the issue analyzer of "Setup Workbench" for *rFactor 2* and *Le Mans Ultimate*. Previously, only oversteer events had been reported. Detecting oversteer events, especially when counter-steering, is still not very reliable, but this is due to invalid angular velocity data in the API.
  - Fixed "Initialize from Session" command for pitstops in the "Team Center" (had been broken with the last release).
  - Added missing reset of session state variables when a session is cleared in the "Team Center".
  - Fixed a bug in the News system that caused articles to be shown too often.

#### Changes

  - Individual tyre service can be selected during the pitstop preparation in "Team Center". See the [updated documentation](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Team-Center#planning-a-pitstop) for more information.
  - The Engineer does not issue multiple pressure loss warnings for the same tyre anymore.
  - Pressure loss information has been added to the session info widgets in "System Monitor".
  - The News reader window can now be resized and will remember its last position.
  - News can be marked as read and will not show again then.
  - [Important] A new version of the local LLM Runtime is available. If you are using the local runtime, please follow the instructions in the [Update Notes](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Update-Notes#release-633).
  - [Developer] NuGet packages are now updated automatically in the build pipeline.
  - [Developer] Pressure loss information has been added to the "Session State.json" file.
  - [Internal] Updated to newer versions of several imported packages for the internal apps and DLLs.

Please also take a look at the [Update Notes](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Update-Notes#release-633), if you are using the local LLM Runtime.

## 6.3.2.0

#### Date: 05/16/25

#### Fixes

  - Several fixes for the Spanish grammars for the Assistants thanks to @alejandrocq.
  - Fixed the data collection and transfer to the session database by the Race Assistants, if the "Solo Center" is **not** active. This bug was introduced with version 6.3.0.
  - Fixed the race situation dependend strategy simulation in "Team Center".
  - Fixed the calculation of stint statistics in "Team Center".
  - Fixed unit conversion for tyre pressure deviation threshold in "Race Settings".
  - Fixed enabling / disabling of setup editor activation in "Setup Workbench" for cars with custom meta data definitions.

#### Changes

  - A [new setting](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Session-Settings) in the "Session Database" allows you to define the threshold for reporting and handling of tyre pressure loss events.
  - The same setting for pressure loss threshold is also available in the ["Race Settings"](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/AI-Race-Engineer#tab-pitstop).
  - Info widgets with information that is all zero, like tyre wear if the data is not supplied by the simulator, are no longer displayed.
  - The handling of restricted tyre sets in the strategy simulation has been optimized. It is no longer possible create strategies where a tyre set is used for more laps than usually possible.
  - Information about available tyre sets is now passed by the Strategist to the LLM, if a strategy is active for the current race.
  - This release introduces initial functionality which supports the handling of individual tyre compounds and tyre changes for individual wheels, if supported by the current simulator, of course. See the [new documentation](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Tyre-Compounds#handling-of-tyre-compounds-on-inidividual-wheels) for more information.
  - [Internal] Migrated to AHK 2.1-alpha.18.

## 6.3.1.0

#### Date: 05/09/25

#### Fixes

  - Fixed validation of function call syntax in controller actions.
  - Fixed the handling of special characters in the API keys for REST/JSON services.
  - Fixed session length calculation for lap-based sessions with active rules set in "Race Settings".
  - Fixed an off by one error, when the Strategist informs the Engineer about the upcoming pitstop.
  - Fixed a bug which allowed for alien tyre compounds for a given car / track combination, if these are defined in the "Rules" of "Race Settings".
  - Fixed handling of used tyre sets in rule-based strategies defined in the "Race Settings".
  - Fixed handling of community tyre pressures in the "Session Database".

#### Changes

  - Updated the handling of the master download mirror.
  - Updated and extended the tyre meta data for *Automobilista 2* (by @alejandrocq).
  - [Internal] Extensive rework and refactoring in preparation for single tyre handling support.

## 6.3.0.0

#### Date: 05/02/25

#### Fixes

  - Fixed auto selection of controller modes (aka Controller Automation) depending of session type. Was broken with the last release with the rewrite of data interfaces.
  - Fixed a bug, which caused the Strategist to recommend a tyre change in heavy rain conditions although wet tyres already were mounted.
  - Removed an orphane entry in the *Temp* directory, if this directory had been moved to a different location.
  - Fixed a typo in the "Simulator" *Lua* module, which prevented the script from being loaded correctly.
  - Fixed a freeze of the "News" window in cases where the user has clicked on "Startup" already.
  - [Important] It has been reported that one of the latest Windows update removed the VC++ runtime, that is used by the plugin for *rFactor 2* and *Le Mans Ultimate*. Please see the [Update Notes](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Update-Notes#release-630) for information how to fix that.

#### Changes

  - The Engineer now better informs about auto adjustments to the refuel amount after a pitstop has been planned and prepared in LMU races.
  - Two new controller action functions [*enableListening* and *disableListening*](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Installation-&-Configuration#actions) allow you to fully mute and unmute voice recognition by a button, for example. This can help, if you are using the same *Push-To-Talk* button with Simulator Controller and Discord or TeamSpeak.
  - Two new controller action functions [*enableDataCollection* and *disableDataCollection*](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Installation-&-Configuration#actions) allow you to disable the transfer of collected data of the Assistants to the session database. This is especially useful to prevent data which originates from sessions with 2x fuel consumption, for example, to pollute the database.
  - The driver is now always included in the default selection of drivers/cars in reports for "Race Reports", "Team Center" or "Solo Center".
  - If the "Reload" button is used in "Race Reports", new cars and tracks, which may have been registered since the start of "Race Reports" will be considered as well.
  - [*Google*](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/AI-Driving-Coach#google) has been added to the list of supported GPT service providers for the Driving Coach and also the Assistant boosters. This makes it possible to the use the *Gemini* models, of which some are even available for free.
  - [Internal] A specialized debugging mode for strategy handling by the Race Strategist can now be enabled in the [core settings](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Core-Configuration#development-settings).

Please also take a look at the [Update Notes](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Update-Notes#release-630), if you are experiencing problems with *rFactor 2* and *le Mans Ultimate*.

## 6.2.9.0

#### Date: 04/25/25

#### Fixes

  - Fixed installation and updating Simulator Controller in the case the Temp folder has been relocated.
  - Fixed a bug which allowed the Telemetry Viewer to be opened without selecting a track beforehand.

#### Changes

  - Added support for more track grip conditions like "Dusty".
  - The Race Engineer no longer announces temperature related pressure corrections, if the pitstop had been completely planned externally, for example in the "Team Center".
  - Actions and Events can now be exported and imported in the Assistant booster editor, so that it is possible now to share them with the community or your team mates.
  - [Expert] Once again comprehensive extensions of the integrated script engine:
    - Several modules haven been defined, which can be included in a *Lua* script using the "require" function. They give you access to the state of the session and also to some functions of the simulator in scripts running in an Assistant booster. See the [new documentation](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Script-Modules) for more information.
	- It is now possible to use *Lua* coroutines even while interface with the host environments or with the Rule Engine.
  - [Internal] Full rewrite of the simulator data acquisition interface.

As mentioned above, this version contains an all new simulator data interface. It has passed all my tests, but tests may not cover everything. Therefore, if you encounter an unexpected behavior, let me know immediately.
  
## 6.2.8.0

#### Date: 04/18/25

#### Fixes

  - Fixed processing of optional arguments in script engine callbacks.
  - Fixed execution of custom *Conversation* booster actions, which has been broken since the introduction of *Lua* scripting.
  - Fixed a critical bug in the session database which prevented settings for wildcard configurations to be applied. This bug was introduced with the character filter for car and track names in the last release.

#### Changes

  - Multiple *Push-To-Talk* buttons are now supported, but you must enter them manually. Separate the key codes by a ";" or by a "|".
  - News & Updates are now shown one at a time on a daily basis and many more articles are available now.
  - All applications of Simulator Controller now collect critical errors and also some statistical information. This data can be transferred to the developer team based on your consent and will be used to enhance the stability and functionality of Simulator Controller.
	- If you want to know what data is being collected, you can inspect the files in [Documents]\Simulator Controller\Diagnostics. All files can be opened with a text editor.
    - You can specify which type of data will be transferred using a [new profile dialog](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Using-Simulator-Controller#managing-your-privacy) in "Simulator Startup".
	- Of course it is possible to fully disable the transfer of diagnostic data.
	- No personal data will ever be transferred. With one exception: Theoretically, your IP address is part of the transferred data, but it will never be used.
	- **Important:** Transfer of information about critical errors and also statistical usage information is **enabled** by default.
  - [Expert] Several additions and enhancements for the integrated *Lua* scripting engine:
    - New [core settings](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Core-Configuration#script-settings) let you specify the directories where *Lua* searches for modules and libraries.
    - Arrays can now be passed in both directions between *Lua* scripts and the host language, where each element of that array can be a literal value or an array by itself.
    - *Lua* scripts have now access to any global object in the host process using the *extern* function. Example: extern("showMessage")("Hello World!"). *extern* can be used to access function objects, but also any other global variable in that process. All global variables, constants and functions of the framework are available using *extern* in any process. See the [Development Guide](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Development-Overview-&-Concepts) for more infomation and reference. 

## 6.2.7.0

#### Date: 04/11/25

#### Fixes

  - Fixed translation of the session type (race, practice, ...) used by the Engineer in cases where the spoken language is different than the language used for the user interface.
  - Invisible characters had been introduced into the "Drivers" database with the automated update procedure of Release 6.2.6. This caused many problems in the "Session Database" and in the handling of driver specific data in general. Fixed with this version.
  - Fixed refuel calculation for the last stint in races with a fixed number of laps.
  - Fixed layout of engine temeperature widget in "System Monitor".
  - Fixed import of race settings into "Strategy Workbench".

#### Changes

  - Changed some calculations for remaining stint laps and remaining session laps for races with a configured post race lap for the last stint.
  - Strategies can now handle a specific number of usable laps per tyre compound mixture. For example, if a soft tyre has been chosen for a given stint, this stint will typically be shorter than one, where hard tyres are used.
    - The usable tyre life can be configured per tyre compound mixture in the [*Rules & Settings* tab](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Strategy-Workbench#rules--settings) of the "Strategy Workbench.
	- It can also be configured in the [*Rules* tab](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/AI-Race-Engineer#tab-rules), if a race is run on simple rules, rather than a full pre-defined strategy.
	- The general "Tyre Usage" setting formerly available in the "Strategy Workbench" has been removed.
	- The strategy simulation will now try to use the best suitable tyre compound mixture for a given stint, even if the "Tyre Compound" *Optimizer* is not used. The decision is based on tyre life and stint length.
	- A [new setting](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Session-Settings) in the "Session Database" allows you to define tyre compound mixture specific tyre life as default values. If a specific setting is not available, 50 laps will be assumed as default. See also the [new section about tyre life](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Tyre-Compounds#usable-life-of-a-tyre-compound) in the [Tyre Compounds](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Tyre-Compounds) documentation chapter.
  - Support for "+ 1 lap" race formats has been added throughout the system.
    - You can choose two additional session types in the "Strategy Workbench" before simulating a strategy - *Time + 1* lap and *Laps + 1* lap. *Time + 1* is supported by *Automobilista 2* and *Project CARS 2* according to my knowledge, but it was easy to add *Laps + 1* as well.
	- For *Automobilista 2* and *Project CARS 2*, the information about additional laps is read from the API.
	- The Engineer adjusts fuel for the additional laps.
	- The announcement of the last lap of the Spotter also uses the information about an additional lap.
	- Lastly, detection of the end of the session will also use this informaton.
  - The "Strategy Workbench" now *remembers* the selected session type.
  - A filter has been integrated which removes characters from car names and track names, before these are stored in the session database. This can make exsiting database entries inaccessible. Please consult the [Update Notes](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Update-Notes#release-637) on information how to restore your data.
  - The tyre meta data for *Automobilista 2* has been updated to reflect a recent change by Reiza in the naming of the Soft, Medium and Hard Slick tyre compounds.
  - [Expert] A new type of *Reasoning* booster named "Rules" has been introduced, which runs without a connected LLM. Only rules are allowed as event source, but all action types, including scripts defined in  [Lua](https://lua.org) are supported. Please read the [extended documentation](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Customizing-Assistants#reasoning-booster) for more information.
    - A new action function / predicate named *Assistant.Trigger* is available, which allows the event rules to trigger a defined action by name, rather than by using an LLM to select the action by the current situation, since no LLM is active when the "Rules" booster is selected.
  - [Expert] The "Assistant.Speak" function / predicate used in the Assistant booster actions now uses the *Rephrasing* booster, if it is configured. This introduces immersive variations of the spoken message.
  - [Expert] Rules defined in the [Hybrid Rule Engine](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Rule-Engine) can now use the *Execute* clause to [call scripts](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Rule-Engine#actions) written in the script language [Lua](https://lua.org) introduced with the last release and vice-versa. This allows you to choose the language, which is best suited for a given task.
  
Please also take a look at the [Update Notes](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Update-Notes#release-627), if you experience inaccessible car or track data in the session database.
  
## 6.2.6.0

#### Date: 04/04/25

#### Fixes

  - Fixed several UTF encoding problems for driver names in the session database.
  - Fixed several translation errors.
  - Fixed refresh of setup list in *Le Mans Ultimate*, if a setup has been saved by the "Setup Workbench".

#### Changes

  - Spotter alerts about accidents in a specific distance got a higher priority.
  - New [core settings](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Core-Configuration) has been defined, which allows you to move the *Temp* folder and also the *Programs* folder of the [Documents]\Simulator Controller folder to a different location. This will be helpful, if your [Documents] folder is under control of *One Drive* or a similar replication tool, since there are reports of several issues and conflicts with the operation of Simulator Controller in that case.
  - The window resizing behaviour for "Strategy Workbench" has been optimized a bit to make the list of available tyre compounds more accessible.
  - This Release introduces support for a new algorithmic scripting language as addition to the support of rule-based programming, which has been around for some time now. The new scripting engine is based on the well-known and wide-spread programming language [Lua](https://lua.org). A long term goal is to use the scripting language for the implementation of all behavioral actions of the Assistants, once they are based on a LAM (aka Large Action Model).
	- The new scripting language can be used to implement actions in *Conversation* and *Reasoning* boosters for the Assistants. See the [updated documentation](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Customizing-Assistants#managing-actions) for more information.
    - Scripting can also be used to implement the [scenario validations](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Strategy-Workbench#script-based-validation) in "Strategy Workbench".
	- Both integrations are already fully functional, but are not yet fully tested for each possible scenario.
  - [Developer] A new constant *kProgramsDirectory* references the location of the *Programs* folder as defined in the configuration. The already present constant *kTempDirectory* also references the configured location now.

## 6.2.5.0

#### Date: 03/28/25

#### Fixes

  - Fixed a bug which crashed the Driving Coach, when the *Reasoning* booster was enabled, but no action had been defined.
  - Fixed a bug which restricted the number of output tokes for the Driving Coach LLM and also for the different Assistant boosters to a max value of 999.
  - Fixed some translations and added a few which were missing.
  - Fixed a bug which caused a request to a *Conversation* booster to fail in case specific informaton wasmissing in the knowledgebase.

#### Changes

  - Changed the default model for a new OpenAI connection to "GPT 4o mini" - this was long overdue.
  - Most data items in the "Administration" tab of the "Session Database" can now be double-clicked. This will either bring you to the specific item list or editor. In case of *Laps* data, a double-click will open a special editor, which allows you to inspect and remove unwanted data, for example, because it has been collected in a session with a consumption multiplier or a tyre wear multiplier. See the [updated documentation](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Session-Database#administration) for more information.
  - [Important] A new version of the local LLM Runtime is available. If you are using the local runtime, please follow the instructions in the [Update Notes](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Update-Notes#release-583).
  - [Developer] Renamed the "TelemetryDatabase" class to "LapsDatabase".

Please also take a look at the [Update Notes](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Update-Notes#release-625), if you are using the local LLM Runtime.

## 6.2.4.0

#### Date: 03/21/25

#### Fixes

  - The Driving Coach do **not** give confirmations anymore for on-track coaching instructions, if confirmations per se are active.
  - Finally found a way to acquire the real driver names for *Le Mans Ultimate* grids.
  - Unicode characters are now displayed correctly for *rFactor 2* and *Le Mans Ultimate*.
  - Fixed many translations for all languages.
  - Fixed a bug in the News system, which prevented more recent News to be presented.
  
#### Changes

  - Driver categories (Silver, Gold, ...) are now supported in all applications for *Le Mans Ultimate*. This information is not (yet) available for non-AI drivers, though, since not (yet) supported by the API.
  - [New voice command for the Race Engineer](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Race-Engineer-Commands-(EN)) lets you ask for the current engine temperatures.
  - New information request action "EngineTemperatures" for the ["Race Engineer"](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Plugins-&-Modes#plugin-race-engineer) plugin can be used to achieve the same result.
  - A new icon in the Stream Deck icon set is provided for the "EngineTemperatures" action.
  - Additional translations for Portuguese thanks to @Hudson Alves. This time the grammars for the Assistants are included as well - see the [new command reference](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Race-Engineer-Commands-(PT)) for the Race Engineer for an example. Translation can be considered complete now.
  - Added several more articels to the News system.

## 6.2.3.0

#### Date: 03/14/25

#### Fixes
  
  - Fixed a bug in the strategy service rules for tyre change and refueling which caused a flip from "Disallowed" to "Always" in some situations.
  - Fixed tyre compound mapping for LMP2 and GTE cars for *Le Mans Ultimate*. All tyre compounds are now available by default.

#### Changes

  - The version number in "Simulator Startup" can now be clicked to open the corresponding release notes for the current version.
  - Renamed several items in the "Session Database" (for example *Race Settings* -> *Settings*, *Tyre Pressures* -> *Pressures*).
  - The documentation page formerly named "Race Settings" has been renamed to ["Session Settings"](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Session-Settings).
  - The layouting system of the Telemetry Viewer now supports grouping of channels into separate clusters. See the [updated documentation](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Session-Database#telemetry-viewer) for more information.
  - Engine water and oil temperatures have been added to the internal data system and are acquired from all simulators, which support this information.
    - New issues have been added to the "Setup Workbench" for engine water and oil temperatures.
    - The [issue analyzer in the "Setup Workbench"](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Setup-Workbench#real-time-issue-analyzer) let you define thresholds for these temperatures which in turn creates issues for the setup development.
	- The engine temperatures have beend added to various reports in "Solo Center" and "Team Center".
	- Setup settings for radiator blankets have been added to the "Setup Workbench".
    - The setup meta data for all cars of *Le Mans Ultimate* and also for all GT3 cars of *rFactor 2* has been updated for the "Setup Workbench". Unfortunately, both simulators do not report water and oil temperatures correctly in the API at the moment, but there is hope at least for *Le Mans Ultimate* for some future update.
	- Oil and water temperatures are passed to the LLM, if an Assistant is connected to a GPT service.
	- A new info widget is available in the "System Monitor" which shows the engine temperatures, if available.
	- [Developer] The same information is available in the "Session State.json" file, if the "Integration" plugin has been enabled.
  - [Important] The file extension for issues saved by the "Setup Workbench" has been renamed from ".setup" to ".issues". If you have such save issue files, you have to change the extension accordingly to make them readable again.
  - If telemetry files are imported from MoTeC, the track is now scanned for coordinates so that the telemetry data can be used by the Driving Coach. Therefore, from now on importing of MoTeC files is only possible, if a track map is available for the given track selection.
  - [Internal] A new FTP site has been setup for the collection, consolidation and distribution of the community database.
  
Please also take a look at the [Update Notes](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Update-Notes#release-623), if you have issue files saved by the "Setup Workbench".

## 6.2.2.0-release 03/07/25
  1. Minor bugfixes, as always
  2. Documentation updates here and there, as always
  3. Fixed track automation for *Le Mans Ultimate* and *rFactor 2* which had been broken since release 6.1.x.
  4. Fixed a bug the suggests that the *Issue Analyzer* in "Settup Workbench" is available for the *Generic* simulator, which is actually not the case.
  5. Fixed a critical crash in *rFactor 2* and *Le Mans Ultimate* data acquisition, if player names do **not** contain a space character.
  6. Fixed a bug in the layout editor of the Telemetry Viewer that caused changes to the current layout being lost, if a new layout was created.
  7. Fixed a crash in the configuration tools, if the Whisper Runtime got deinstalled, but still was selected as active voice recognition engine.
  8. Fixed several redraw issues in the "Session Database".
  9. Added some missing translations for the Telemetry Viewer.
  10. The application of the *Rephrasing* booster has been optimized so that the LLM is allowed to rearrange the speech as long as the meaning is preserved. This will introduce even more variation into long speeches.
  11. The instructions for the *Rephrasing* booster have been updated. If you have tweaked them, revert them to their original state and re-integrate your changes.
  12. The "RF2" and the "LMU" plugin now offer a "Chat" mode similar to the one already available for the "ACC" plugin. Using this, you can send predefined chat messages using your Button Box, or even automated based on some events.
  13. When sessions are saved by the "Solo Center", the type of the session (practice, race, ...) will be used as default name together with the current date.
  14. It is now possible to configure the application *Second Monitor* as the source for real time telemetry data. See the [added documentation](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Solo-Center#choosing-the-telemetry-provider) on information about how to configure a connection between Simulator Controller and *Second Monitor*.
     - The type of telemetry provider and thus the connection to *Second Monitor* in the different applications ("Solo Center", "Team Center" and "Setup Workbench") can be selected in the Telemetry Viewer.
     - If you want to use *Second Monitor* also for the Driving Coach, this can be configured using new [settings](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Session-Settings) in the "Session Database".
	 - The [documentation](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Team-Center#telemetry-viewer) about how to use telemetry data in team sessions has been clarified.
  15. You can now copy the name of a selected telemetry in the "Session Database" to the clipboard.
  16. The settings for "Private Practice" and "Private Qualifying" are now also available as "Functions" in the Startup Profiles.
  17. Updated car meta data for *RaceRoom Racing Experience* to the latest version.
  18. Missing values in the telemetry data graph, which resulted in broken lines, are now interpolated.
  19. Thanks to our community member @Hudson Alves, this release comes with the first part of the translations for the Portuguese language. Still some more releases needed to complete the task, for example voice control is not yet supported in Portuguese, but we have a good start.
  20. [Important] The tab "Laps" in the "Session Database" has been renamed to "Telemetries". Furthermore, the data category "Telemetry" in the "Administration" tab has been renamed to "Laps". Looks a bit confusing, since it seems like a swap of names, but it reflects the actual meaning of those items much more precisely than before.
  21. [Internal] The "Temp" folder in the [Documents]\Simulator Controller folder is now used for the installation and update process instead of the standard AppData\Local\Temp folder. This may help to further reduce interventions of AntiVirus programs, when an exclusion for [Documents]\Simulator Controller already has been declared as recommended.

Please also take a look at the [Update Notes](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Update-Notes#release-622), if you have tweaked your *Rephrasing* booster instructions.

## 6.2.1.0-release 02/27/25
  1. Minor bugfixes, as always
  2. Documentation updates here and there, as always
  3. Several minor fixes for the Team Server including automatic deletion of expired accounts.
  4. Fixed a rare bug in session startup for *Le Mans Ultimate*, when only a practice session has been configured.
  5. Fixed some track names for *iRacing*.
  6. Fixed a rare bug in the telemetry acquisition for *rFactor 2* and *Le Mans Ultimate* where throttle, brake, gear, and so on were always reported as unavailable.
  7. Fixed Simulator Controller not a accepting a different simulator once *Le Mans Ultimate* has been used.
  8. It is no longer possible to set a track automation point in "Session Database", if there is no currently selected set of track automations.
  9. The track mapper resilience against precision deficits has been increased for *iRacing*.
  10. Increased resilience against corrupted telemetry layout definitions. Still do not understand, why they get corrupted in the first place.
  11. The "Strategy Workbench" now includes an "Auto Initialize" setting (default is True) which triggers automatic initialization of several settings from the session database and/or a strategy, which has been loaded manually.
  12. Straights can now be given names in track maps as it has already been possible for corners.
  13. Full support for importing iRacing IBT files into the "Session Database" as telemetry reference laps. Please take a look at the [updated documentation](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Session-Database#importing-telemetry-data) for more information. Please note, that importing IBT files requires a valid track map for the given track to be available, since all values from the IBT file will be mapped to the internal coordinate system.
  14. Several default values have been changed for simulator specific settings in "Simulator Setup" and "Simulator Configuration" to make initial configuration more *easy* for beginners.
  15. A new [setting](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Session-Settings) "Spotter: Private Practice" let you suppress proximity alerts and other opponent related information by the Spotter in private practice sessions. Use this setting for example in *Le Mans Ultimate* or other simulators where you can choose to *ghost* all other cars on the track.
  16. A new [setting](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Session-Settings) "Spotter: Private Qualifying" let you suppress proximity alerts and other opponent related information by the Spotter in private qualifying. Use this setting for example in *Le Mans Ultimate* or other simulators where qualifying is being held without any other cars on the track.
  17. The "Basic" configuration step of "Simulator Setup" is now an integral part of the configuration process after the initial setup. Only during the first configuration, you have the choice to skip the "Basic" configuration step and directly continue with the "Extended" configuration to install additional software in custom locations, for example. As before, you can stop after the "Basic" configuration, or you can simply continue to the "Extended" configuration.
  18. [Important] The default value for the [setting](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Session-Settings) "Repeat whole voice message" has changed for all Assistants from *True* to *False* in the "Session Database". This means, that an Assistant from now on will only repeat the last sentence by default, if got interrupted by another Assistant. If you want to restore the previous behaviour, include and change the setting in the [settings](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Session-Settings) of the "Session Database" for your simulators.
  19. Implemented a *News* system which will give you from time to time interesting or important information about Simulator Controller in general or upcoming features. And of course I will also ask you to support the project once in a while.
  20. [Internal] Changed some compiler options to make AntiVirus programs more happy.
  21. New car models for "Setup Workbench":
      - Le Mans Ultimate
	    - Aston Martin Vantage AMR LMGT3
		- Ford Mustang LMGT3
		- Porsche 911 GT3 R LMGT3
  
Please also take a look at the [Update Notes](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Update-Notes#release-621), if you are hosting your own Team Server.

## 6.2.0.0-release 02/21/25
  1. Minor bugfixes, as always
  2. Documentation updates here and there, as always
  3. Fixed validation of pressures in "Race Settings", when kPa is selected as pressure unit.
  4. Fixed a crash in "Simulator Setup" and "Simulator Configuration" when selecting the Azure GPT provider.
  5. Fixed a rare bug for handling RPM values in the *iRacing* telemetry data acquisition.
  6. Fixed a rare bug which only shows up when the *Reasoning* booster is used and you are running out ot fuel. This caused the Engineer to loose its focus.
  7. The voice recognition test mode in "Simulator Setup" and "Simulator Configuration" now starts all four Assistants.
  8. The Race Engineer no longer informs you about repairs that are actually not needed, if a pitstop has been triggered manually using the "Team Center" or by the Race Strategist as a result of the active strategy.
  9. The Race Engineer will now tell you that you have recovered your pace after an accident and that a repiar, which was originally recommended are actually not longer worthwhile.
  10. When using *rFactor 2* the Race Engineer no longer requests the current pitstop settings from the simulator while the car is in the pitlane. This prevents a potential delay in pitstop servicing, if the *rFactor 2* Pitstop MFD is running through the options and settings.
  11. The installation and update procedure has been overhauled to be more resilient against unavailable download mirrors.
  12. A new voice recognition system has been made available, which supports free speech and provides an excellent alternative to Azure and Google voice recognition services, as long as you have some memory available on your graphics card while runniing your preferred simulator. It is based on Whisper, a multilingual solution based on neural network technology provided in the open source by OpenAI. Please see the [added documentation](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Installation-&-Configuration#whisper-runtime) for more information on how to install and use Whisper.
  13. With the genereous support of @Caleidosttk, I have set up a new download mirror for all installation and update packages. The problems seen recently with the unavailable download repository, after so many new users joined our community, should be a thing of the past now.

## 6.1.6.0-release 02/14/25
  1. Minor bugfixes, as always
  2. Documentation updates here and there, as always
  3. Fixed a rare error where the session mode in a Startup Profile was reset to "Solo".
  4. Fixed voice recognition test mode, which was broken for some time now.
  5. Fixed superfluous validation errors for Button Box layouts introduced with the last release.
  6. Fixed wet tyre compound specifier for *Le Mans Ultimate* GTE cars.
  7. Added several missing translations.
  8. The Telemetry Viewer now remembers the chosen layout and restores it the next time.
  9. Improved detection of exact car location in the pitlane for *Assetto Corsa*, *Automobilista 2*, *Le Mans Ultimate*, *rFactor 2* and *iRacing*.
  10. The chosen track editor mode will be now remembered between runs of the "Session Database".
  11. The Race Engineer now tries to prevent preparation of a pitstop while the car is in the pitlane, since the driver might actually doing a drive-through with engaged pit limiter. Since the processing is inherently asynchronous, there is still a chance that the pit limiter will be disengaged, if a pitstop is prepared while serving a penalty at the same time, but the chance for such a problem is reduced quite a lot.
  12. Corners can now be given names in the track map. See the [revised documentation](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Session-Database#track--automation) for information on how to do this. If you have configured corner names, the Driving Coach may use the name rather than a simple number when referencing a corner.
      - If available, corner names will be shown in the title bar of the inspector window of the Telemetry Viewer.
	  - They will also be included in the tool tips, if the mouse is hoovering above one of the section points in the track map of the "Session Database".
      - Tool tips are now also available for section points in the track map of the Telemetry Viewer, and of course, the corner names will be shown there as well.
  13. The Driving Coach will now use corner names, if available, to reference a specific corner.
      - Corner names must have been defined for the track map (see item 12. above)
      - The Driving Coach instructions have been updated. If you have tweaked your instructions, you may want to revert to original and include your changes again.
  14. [Expert] The meta information between <think> and </think> is now removed automatically from the answer, when models like deepseek-r1 are used.
  15. [Internal] Improved handling of inter process messages in cases where message processing needs longer than usual.
  16. [Internal] Updated WebView2, the internal HTML renderer, to the latest version.
  17. [Developer] The framework extensions formerly located in the "Libraries" folder in the sources tree has been moved to the folder "Framework\Extensions".
  
Please also take a look at the [Update Notes](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Update-Notes#release-616), if you have tweaked your Drving Coach instructions.

## 6.1.5.0-release 02/07/25
  1. Minor bugfixes, as always
  2. Documentation updates here and there, as always
  3. Fixed a crash in "Setup Workbench" for cars with parantheses "(" and ")" in their names.
  4. Fixed the default value for pitlane delta default value in those rare cases, when not available from the settings. The default value is 60 seconds, which is the maximum value for all known tracks.
  5. Fixed display of cold tyre pressure recommendations in the lap report of the "Team Center" and "Solo Center".
  6. Fixed a problem when a non-existent speech recognizer is selected for Azure voice recognition.
  7. The "Restricted" mode, which is activated whenever no valid GPT connection is configured for the Driving Coach, is now displayed correctly in all cases in the "System Monitor".
  8. The "Team" tab in "Race Settings" are now automatically preselected, when "Race Settings" is opened to edit the team race credentials.
  9. The layout editor for Button Boxes has been extended with additional validations, so that no invalid layouts can be defined anymore.
  10. The Engineer will now use the most recent values of remaining fuel, tyre temperatures and pressures as well as brake temperatures (if available) rather than the values at the start of the current lap, when asked for this information using a voice command or a controller action.
  11. The special validation rules in "Setup Workbench" can now be edited using a specialized syntax aware editor for the underlying rule language. See the [extended documentation](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Strategy-Workbench#editing-validation-rules-and-scripts) for more information.
  12. Inner, Middle and Outer carcass tyre temperature readings are now supported for *rFactor 2*, *Le Mans Ultimate* and *iRacing* in "Solo Center" and in the issue analyzer of "Setup Workbench".
  13. The real setup pressures from the garage are now used by the Race Engineer for *iRacing*.
  14. [Expert] A new version of the local LLM Runtime is available, which includes the latest Llama backend. Support for the deepseek v3 model is included, if you have 800 GB of memory in your machine :-)
  15. [Internal] Increased reliability of shared memory connectors.
  16. [Internal] Added sensible information to the manifest of all executable files.
  
Please also take a look at the [Update Notes](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Update-Notes#release-615), if you are using the local LLM Runtime.

## 6.1.4.0-release 01/31/25
  1. Minor bugfixes, as always
  2. Documentation updates here and there, as always
  3. Fixed time of second sector in "Solo Center" and "Team Center" for *rFactor 2* and *Le Mans Ultimate*.
  4. Fixed track scanning in the track map of the Telemetry Viewer, which was broken with the last release.
  5. Fixed strategy handling in "Autonomous" mode.
  6. Fixed track mapping for *iRacing*.
  7. A lot of fine-tuning for the recently added rule-based strategy handling.
  8. All Spotter announcements from the "Tactical Advices" group do not interrupt announcements of other Assistants anymore.
  9. The Driving Coach now provides a new mode for on-track coaching in which you will be given a [review of your performance](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/AI-Driving-Coach#focusing-on-specific-corners) at a given corner compared to the last lap.
     - New voice commands let you provide the numbers for those corners where you want to get a post corner review. See the [extended documentation](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/AI-Driving-Coach#list-of-all-voice-commands) for a description.
	 - A new LLM instruction is available which can be customized to control the different aspects of the critics given by the Driving Coach.
  10. Optimized the Driving Coach instructions used when approaching a corner.
  11. Updated car meta data for *RaceRoom Racing Experience* to the latest version.
  12. [Expert] "Simulator Startup" now supports the [integration of additional startup scripts](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Using-Simulator-Controller#customizing-startup-configuration) to customize your environment when starting up Simulator Controller.
  13. [Internal] Migrated to AHK 2.1-alpha.15.
  14. New car models for "Setup Workbench":
      - rFactor 2
	    - Mercedes AMG GT3
		- Porsche 911 GT3 R
		- Radical RXC Turbo GT3
		- McLaren 650s GT3 (fixed Aero Height at the front)
		
      With this release, the list of GT3 cars for *rFactor 2* is complete (with only the latest version for the Audi and the Bentley). I won't create meta data for more cars, but doing this on your own is easy. Let me know, and I will be happy to give instructions.

## 6.1.3.0-release 01/24/25
  1. Minor bugfixes, as always
  2. Documentation updates here and there, as always
  3. Fixed several missing translations.
  4. When unblocking DLLs and Applications a fake certificate is also created to work around the invalid handling of client side certificate requests by OpenAI.
  5. Initial support for *Assetto Corsa EVO*. Not much functionality yet...
  6. "Race Settings" has been [extended](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/AI-Race-Engineer#tab-rules) and allows now to define basic race rules for the next race.
  7. The Strategist can now create a strategy dynamically based on simple race rules configured in the "Race Settings". See the [new documentation](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/AI-Race-Strategist#tab-rules) for more information.
  8. The default for the [setting](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Session-Settings) "Engineer: Tyre Service" has changed to "Change" for *Automobilista 2*, *Project CARS 2* and *RaceRoom Racing Experience*, because these simulators do not support adjusting pressures during a pitstop.
  9. Auto requesting the pitstop for *Automobilista 2* can now be configured in the [settings](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Session-Settings) in the "Session Database".

     **IMPORTANT**: The default for this setting is *False*, which is **different** from the previously implemented behaviour.
  10. A new action "PitstopRequest" has been defined for the *Automobilista 2* plugin to request a pitstop manually.
  11. New car models for "Setup Workbench":
      - rFactor 2
        - Audi R8 LMS GT3 (Variante 2019)
		- Bentley Continental GT3 (Variante 2020)
		- BMW M6 GT3
		- Callaway Corvette C7 GT3-R
		- McLaren 650s GT3

Please also take a look at the [Update Notes](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Update-Notes#release-613), especially if you want to include support for *Assetto Corsa EVO*.

## 6.1.2.1-release 01/19/25
  1. Workaround for incompatible OpenAI client certificate request.

## 6.1.2.0-release 01/17/25
  1. Minor bugfixes, as always
  2. Documentation updates here and there, as always
  3. Fixed a bug in the Spanish grammars for the Spotter, which caused it to crash when announcing a new best lap for the leader.
  4. Fixed a tyre compound mapping bug for FUSA cars in *Automobilista 2*. Looks like the tyre compounds have changed recently a lot in this simulator, so there may be a lot of additional mapping errors.
  5. Fixed some calculations for *Le Mans Ultimate* with regards to imperial units.
  6. Fixed gallon to liter conversions for *Le Mans Ultimate*. Although the setting in LMU is named "imperial", it does not refer to the imperial gallon, which is roughly 4.5 liters. Rather it refers to the US gallon which is around 3.7 liters. Another weird LMU thing.
  7. Changed default for activation recognizer to "Windows (Desktop)" rather than "Windows (Server)" voice recognition.
  8. Major update to the documentation - removed the term "virtual".
  9. The telemetry collector for *Assetto Corsa Competizione* has been improved.
  10. Optimized end of session detection for *iRacing* for timed races.
  11. Implemented a workaround for *iRacing* results at the end of a session, which are reported asynchronously by the simulator. Works in most cases, but not in all.
  12. A detailed weather forecast is now available for *Le Mans Ultimate*.
  13. The track grip status has been refined for *rFactor 2* and *Le Mans Ultimate*. It is now mostly consistent with the status given in the simulator.
  14. The overall pitstop service time is now calculated more precisely for *Le Mans Ultimate*.
  15. A short sound is played now, whenever an Assistant action is triggered by the *Reasoning* booster. This helps to understand whether a given behaviour is caused by a connected LLM.
  16. [Expert] The format of action definitions in the *Conversation* and in the *Reasoning* booster has changed. See the [revised documentation](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Customizing-Assistants#managing-actions) for more information.
  17. New car models for "Setup Workbench":
      - rFactor 2
        - McLaren 720s GT3
		- Aston Martin Vantage GT3
	  - Le Mans Ultimate

Please also take a look at the [Update Notes](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Update-Notes#release-612), if you are using actions in the *Conversation* booster.

## 6.1.1.0-release 01/10/25
  1. Minor bugfixes, as always
  2. Documentation updates here and there, as always
  3. Fixed management of Stream Deck Icons for German and French UI settings.
  4. Fixed a bug in the handling of the *rFactor 2* pitstop settings that caused an infinite loop, if each tyre could be changed individually.
  5. Lowered the threshold values for the different rain levels in *rFactor 2* and *Le Mans Ultimate* so that pitting for tyres is recommended earlier.
  6. Safety Cars are now removed from the grid in *Automobilista 2* (and probably *Project CARS 2*) in most cases.
  7. The strategy information given by the Strategist has been updated to be more concise if no more pitstops are needed.
  8. The reliability of the track spline builder for *Assetto Corsa Competizione* has been improved. This positively affects the accident detection by the Spotter and the collection of car telemetry data by various applications.
  9. Pressure values are now converted to the specified display unit in "Setup Workbench".
  10. A short sound is played now, whenever an Assistant answer is given by the *Conversation* booster. This helps to understand whether a given answer is absolutely reliable or not.
  11. The [setting "Engineer: Tyre Service"](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Session-Settings) in the "Session Database" has been extended to choose between no tyre service, change of tyres with unchanged pressures, or full service including pressure adjustment by the Race Engineer.
  12. New settings in the [settings](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Session-Settings) has been defined for *rFactor 2* and *Le Mans Ultimate*, which will enable auto-requesting of the pitstop in the simulator after all pitstop settings has been updated by the Race Engineer in the preparation phase.
  13. Full support for editing of *Le Mans Ultimate* setups in "Setup Workbench". Meta data is included for all cars with one exception. For the Peugeot 9x8, only the 2024 version is supported, the one with the adjustable wing.
  14. Support for *rFactor 2* has been included in "Setup Workbench" as well, but no meta data for any car has been defined yet. Creating meta data on your own for the car of your choice is not that complicated. Take a look [here](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Setup-Workbench#introducing-a-new-car) for more information.

Please also take a look at the [Update Notes](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Update-Notes#release-610) for on information on how to restore your session database content, if you have used *Le Mans Ultimate* previously.

## 6.1.0.1-release 01/03/25
  1. Fixed a timing issue when requesting data from *Le Mans Ultimate*.

## 6.1.0.0-release 01/03/25
  1. Minor bugfixes, as always
  2. Documentation updates here and there, as always
  3. Fxied a bug in the processing of the voice command which handles tyre compound selection during pitstop preparation.
  4. Fixed handling of non-available engine maps in strategy simulation.
  5. Fixed handling of Stream Deck Mini layouts in "Simulator Setup".
  6. Fixed lap time delta announcement when requesting lap times by voice command.
  7. Added missing FCY command in the Assistant mode of all simulator plugins.
  8. Renamed "Initial Conditions" simulation to "Fixed" simulation in "Strategy Workbench".
  9. Several new settings in the [settings](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Session-Settings) for the new "Time Trial" session type which was introduced with version 6.0.2.
  10. A new [core setting](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Core-Configuration) allow you to configure a special mode, which enables the *Push-to-Talk* button to interrupt the currently active speech.
  11. Fixed display of unavailable pressures in "Solo Center" and "Team Center".
  12. More progress bars and message windows will be suppressed if Simulator Controller is running in *silent* mode.
  13. The projected position after the upcoming pitstop will be available in the LLM knowledge and also in the session info of the "System Monitor", if the strategy was calculated by the Strategist with activated traffic simulation.
  14. Finally full support for management of pitstop settings and pitstop automation by the Assistants in *Le Mans Ultimate*.
      - The car models are correctly named now (they have been the team names in the past). Due to this, all entries in the session database have been invalidated and the database for *Le Mans Ultimate* has been cleared. See the [Update Notes](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Update-Notes#release-610) for information how to restore your previous database content.
	  - The Race Engineer cannot handle different tyre compounds for the different wheels yet and he also will currently always change all four tyres together. Please see the [extended documentation](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Plugins-&-Modes#special-notes-for-le-mans-ultimate) for more information about this and also additional restrictions.
	  - New voice command for the Race Engineer that triggers recalulation of the fuel ratio. See the [extended documentation](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/AI-Race-Engineer#list-of-all-voice-commands) for a description.
	  - New controller action "FuelRatioOptimize" that triggers the recalution of the fuel ratio as well. A new icon for the Stream Deck is included.
	  - A new setting in the [settings](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Session-Settings) of the "Session Database" that enables automatic recalculation of the fuel ratio.
	  - A new setting in the [settings](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Session-Settings) of the "Session Database" that activates automatic adjustment of the virtual energy level for the last stint, if you pit later than planned.
	  - If you want to use all this stuff, it is really important that you read the [special notes](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Plugins-&-Modes#special-notes-for-le-mans-ultimate) about the *Le Mans Ultimate* integration since the handling of virtual energy is quite different than just topping up the fuel and you need to understand what is going on there.
  15. Handling of individual tyre change and/or tyre compounds has been implemented for *RaceRoom Racing Experience*, *rFactor 2*, *Le Mans Ultimate* and *iRacing*. This is available as individual controller actions for Button Box or Stream Decks. The Race Engineer will still change all four tyres at once and will always select the same compound for all four wheels.
	  - New controller actions "TyreChangeFront" and "TyreChangeRear" for *RaceRoom Racing Experience*.
      - New controller actions "TyreCompoundFront" and "TyreCompoundRear" for *rFactor 2*.
	  - New controller actions "TyreCompoundFrontLeft", "TyreCompoundFrontRight", "TyreCompoundRearLeft" and "TyreCompoundRearRight" for *Le Mans Ultimate*.
      - New controller actions "TyreChangeFrontLeft", "TyreChangeFrontRight", "TyreChangeRearLeft" and "TyreChangeRearRight" for *iRacing*.
  16. New controller action "PitstopRequest" for *rFactor 2*.
  17. New controller actions "BrakeChange" and "PitstopRequest" for *Le Mans Ultimate*.
  18. Many new Stream Deck icons for the above controller actions.
  19. The definition of the "RepairRequest" controller action for *iRacing* has changed. You may want to check your configuration, if you use this action.
  20. [Internal] Improved task management in database synchronization process.
  21. [Internal] Updated all copyright notes to 2025.

Please also take a look at the [Update Notes](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Update-Notes#release-610) for on information on how to restore your session database content, if you have used *Le Mans Ultimate* previously.

## 6.0.3.0-release 12/27/24
  1. Minor bugfixes, as always
  2. Documentation updates here and there, as always
  3. Fixed a critical bug introduced with the 6.0.2 that caused pitstop changes to be applied twice in some cases, when using Button Box and/or Stream Deck.
  4. Several new settings in the [settings](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Session-Settings) for the new "Time Trial" session type which was introduced with version 6.0.2.

## 6.0.2.0-release 12/20/24
  1. Minor bugfixes, as always
  2. Documentation updates here and there, as always
  3. Fixed a rare bug in the handling of deactivated voice recognition, which caused unnecessary error messages popping up.
  4. Fixed a bug in "Solo Center" which prevented auto saving of sessions, when auto exporting was enabled.
  5. Fixed several problems with the Spanish voice recognition of the Driving Coach.
  6. The progress bar will not open up in the "Solo Center", if data is exported in the background, because auto save is enabled.
  7. Track sections will now automatically be detected, if required.
     - You can use the new "Scan" method while in the "Edit" mode of the track map in the Telemetry Viewer. Track sections will be created based on the currently selected telemetry data. Since this is a heuristical approach, please check (and edit) the created section starting points afterwards. Once you are fine with the track sections, store them permanently using the "Save" button.
     - The Telemetry Viewer will also create track sections on the fly, if no sections have been created and stored together with the track in the session database so far. Since this is using a quite complex data analysis, it takes a few seconds each time, and it is also not perfect, as just mentioned. Therefore I recommend to do it once and store the track sections into the session database.
     - The Driving Coach will also use automatically generated track sections if none are yet configured for the given track. Same remarks apply here.
  8. New "On-track Coaching" function in the [startup profile](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Using-Simulator-Controller#startup-profiles), which automatically starts telemetry based coaching and on-track coaching by the Driving Coach when this startup profile is active.
  9. On-track coaching can now also enabled from the tray menu of the "Simulator Controller" process.
  10. Additional arguments for the controller action functions [*startTelemetryCoaching* and *startTrackCoaching*](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Installation-&-Configuration#actions), that let you control whether the Driving Coach will confirm the command.
  11. Support for an additional session type named "Time Trial" has been added to all applications.
      - Hotlap and time trial modes of the different simulators are mapped to this single session type.
	  - General support by all Assistants is comparable to "Qualification".
	  - Corresponding settings for the different Assistant services has been added to the "Session Database".
  12. [Expert] Many parameters of all Race Assistant plugins have been renamed. The old names are still supported for compatibility reasons, but they are deprecated.
  13. [Expert] Corner by corner instructions of the Driving Coach are now written to the "Session State.json" file which can be used to implement SimHub Dashboards and Overlays.

## 6.0.1.0-release 12/13/24
  1. Minor bugfixes, as always
  2. Documentation updates here and there, as always
  3. Fixed editing of track automation points, which was broken with 6.0.0.
  4. A new controller action "Interrupt" is available for all Assistants, which can be used to interrupt a lengthy speech. Bind it to a button on your steering wheel for all Assistants, for example.
  5. New Stream Deck icon for the above "Interrupt" action.
  6. The telemetry importer has been improved to also read the lap time, sector times, and so on, if this information is available. This is useful, when importing lap telemetry data after a race from the telemetry collection of the Driving Coach, which is located in [Documents]\Simulator Controller\Temp\Driving Coach\Telemetry.
  7. A new convinience shortcut has been implemented in "Simulator Startup" to select the startup profile. Hold down the mouse button for at least a second when clicking on the "Startup" button to choose the profile for the next startup. See the [extended documentation](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Using-Simulator-Controller#notes) for more information.
  8. The Driving Coach now supplies a basic and somewhat [restricted on-track coaching](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/AI-Driving-Coach#using-the-driving-coach-without-an-llm) when an LLM for the Coach has not yet been configured. Since this is the default configuration for a fresh installation, the Coach is already usable to some extent without being fully configured.
  9. The automatic startup of the on-track coaching as described [here](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/AI-Driving-Coach#automatic-activation-of-coaching-mode) has been updated, so that the acquired knowledge does not get removed after the end of a session.
  10. "Session Database" now supports to open the documentation for the selected database category by holding down the Control key when clicking on the category. Or you can click on the small "Documentation" button in the upper right corner of the main window.
  11. [Internal] Optimized asynchronous speaking status of all Assistants. This gives the Driving Coach more room for the corner by corner instructions. 
  
## 6.0.0.0-release 12/06/24
  1. Minor bugfixes, as always
  2. Documentation updates here and there, as always
  3. A stunning new feature, a [fully interactive coaching mode](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/AI-Driving-Coach#coaching-based-on-lap-telemetry-data) is now offered by the Driving Coach. The coach will take a look at the live telemetry data and will tell you where you have to change your driver inputs and driving style to ultimately improve your lap time.
     - Many new voice commands have been defined to start a coaching session and also to interact with the Driving Coach during coaching. See the [voice command reference for English](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Driving-Coach-Commands-(EN)) (or for any of the other supported languages) for more information.
	 - A controller action "TelemetryCoaching" has been defined for the [Driving Coach plugin](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Plugins-&-Modes#plugin-driving-coach) to start / finish a coaching session from your Button Box or Stream Deck.
	 - A controller action "TrackCoaching" has been defined for the [Driving Coach plugin](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Plugins-&-Modes#plugin-driving-coach) to request active coaching while driving from your Button Box or Stream Deck.
	 - New icons for the "TelemetryCoaching" and "TrackCoaching" actions has been added to the Stream Deck icon set.
	 - Several new settings in the [settings](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Session-Settings) to fine-tune the corner by corner coaching of the Driving Coach.
     - New controller action functions [*startTelemetryCoaching*, *finishTelemetryCoaching*, *startTrackCoaching* and *finishTrackCoaching*](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Installation-&-Configuration#actions) allow you to control the telemetry-based coaching mode from custom functions and scripts. Even use them in LLM actions in the *Reasoning* booster.
     - Many new [system level instructions](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/AI-Driving-Coach#instructions) for the Driving Coach, which guide the LLM through the complex resoning process.
	 - Telemetry data for reference laps can be stored weather specific in the "Session Database".
	 - Several other changes and additions in the documentation for the [Driving Coach](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/AI-Driving-Coach), which will make worth to re-read the chapter.
  4. The *Rephrasing*, *Understanding* and *Reasoning* boosters are now available for the Driving Coach as well. For obvious reasons, there is no need for the *Conversation* booster.
  5. A new info popup shows important information about the nearest track section when clicking at a specific spot in the Telemetry Viewer or the assoiated track map. See the [updated documentation](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Session-Database#telemetry-viewer) for more information.
  6. The detection of click / drag of track points in the track map editor has been improved.
  7. The Spotter no longer informs about lap time delta which is actually zero.
  8. [Expert] The *Reasoning* booster can now be used without an LLM, if you only want to extend the rule base of an Assistant. See the [updated documentation](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Customizing-Assistants#reasoning-booster) for more information.

This is used to normalize the steering angle when importing telemetry data from MoTeC, for example. If this setting is not set, the latest value used in the "Setup Workbench" for this car will be used.
  14. The announcement of the last lap times of the cars around you by the Spotter has been moved from the "Session Information" group to the "Opponent Information" group and can be enabled/disabled together with ´gap and delta information in the configuration.
  15. Reduced frequency of superfluous proximity alerts by the Spotter.
  
## 5.9.3.0-release 10/11/24

IMPORTANT READ: A nasty bug had been introduced with the last release, which for some user broke the telemetry / issue analyzer in "Setup Workbench". A very early version of "Setup Workbench" stored files in *[Documents]\Simulator Controller\Garage\Definitions* for personal modification. This was no longer necessary with a later release, but the files were left in place. They now collide with the latest version of "Setup Workbench".

What does that all mean for you:

1. If you have never modified those files, you are fine. Everything is back to normal again.
2. If you have modified at least one of those files, for example to introduce a new setting for a simulator, you will find your files now in *[Documents]\Simulator Controller\Garage\Definitions\Backup* where they do no harm. Please read the documentation about [extending the "Setup Workbench"](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Setup-Workbench#extending-and-cutomizing-setup-workbench) for information how to bring your changes back in.

And now back to the usual Release Notes:

  1. Minor bugfixes, as always
  2. Documentation updates here and there, as always
  3. Fixed a rare bug, which prevented the selection of start stint pressures in "Team Center".
  4. Fixed an error in strategy simulation which did not respect the stint timer, when running an autonomous Strategist.
  5. Fixed saving of telemetry data imported from "Second Monitor".
  6. Fixed a bug, that causes action definitions and settings to get lost in the Assistant Booster configuration.
  7. Fixed enabling and disabling of *Reasoning* booster in "Simulator Setup".
  8. Fixed telemetry / issue analyzer for "Setup Workbench" (see above).
  9. The Spotter now compares the drivers lap time to that of the opponents when announcing recent lap times.
  10. The window resizing has been optimized for "Session Database".
  11. Weather-specific personal best lap times retrieved from the session database are now passed to the LLM of the *Reasoning* booster for decision support.
  12. Using new settings in the [settings](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Session-Settings) you can specify the ideal tyre temperatures for the different tyre compounds. They can be used to trigger tyre temperature related pitstop recommendations.
  13. Updated car meta data for *RaceRoom Racing Experience* to the latest version.

IMPORTANT: Please take a look at the [Update Notes](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Update-Notes#release-593), if you have configured the *Reasoning* booster for any of the Assistants.

## 5.9.2.2-release 10/04/24
  1. Fixed a critical bug which prevented the Strategist to announce an upcoming weather change.

## 5.9.2.1-release 10/04/24

     - Renamed the "Telemetry Browser" everywhere to "Telemetry Viewer".
  5. Lap telemetry data opened in the Telemetry Viewer from a source other than the current session, will now also show the driver name, if available.
  6. A third graph has been added to the Telemetry Viewer, which shows longitudinal and lateral G-Forces and also an information about the curvature of the current corner.
  7. Lap telemetry data can now be imported from "Second Monitor", a sophisticated tool developed by Matus Celko (@winzarten). See the [revised documentation](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Session-Database#telemetry-viewer) for more information.
  8. The selection dialog for telemetry data now supports opening multiple lap telemetries at once by shift-clicking in the list. The file selection dialog opened by the "Open..." button also supports multi-selection.
  9. The Telemetry Viewer now can display a track map in a separate. You can click in the graph to show the corresponding location on the track map and vice versa. Only telemetry data collected with 5.9.2 and later will support this. If *WebView2* is configured as HTML Viewer in the [core settings](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Core-Configuration), it will not work yet either. See the [revised documentation](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Session-Database#telemetry-viewer) for more information.
  10. A rotating ball is now displayed, when the Telemetry Viewer is collecting lap telemetry data.
  11. "Setup Workbench" now also supports collecting lap telemetry data. See the [added documentation](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Setup-Workbench#telemetry-viewer) for more information.
  12. The Track Automation state is now displayed with color coding on a Button Box. Gray if it is enabled but not yet available, and yellow if no Automation has been defined for the given track and Green, if enabled and active.
  13. The setting to startup a simulation together with Simulator Controller has been moved from the global settings of "Simulator Startup" to the Startup Profiles. Veeery useful...

  9. Thanks to our community member @Diego Falcone Dev_Dk HawkOne we now have a full translation for the Italian language.
  10. It is now possible ot use a voice which was trained for a specific language for another language. The results are mediocre for the speech synthesizer built into Windows, but very usable for voices supplied by Azure or Google. It is kind of cool to hear an Italian speak English.
  11. [Internal] A new system process observes all user processes and immediately kills them in case of malfunction. The most important and malicious type of malfunction is too much memory consumption, for which the threshold could be defined in the [core settings](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Core-Configuration).
  12. [Internal] Added a special [credits page](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Credits) to the documentation with a tribute to all my supporters and contributors. This page can also be opened from "Simulator Startup".

  6. Potentially fixed a bug that created corrupted driver names in *Automobilista 2* and *Project CARS 2*.
  7. The "Practice Center" now handles unnumbered tyre sets like Wet tyres, for example, correctly in terms of tyre usage.
  8. "Practice Center" now also can [open every report in a separate window](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Solo-Center#notes), similar to the "Race Center" behaviour introduced with Release 5.8.3. To open a report in a separate window, hold down the Control key while choosing the report.
  9. The team management editor in "Simulator Startup" has become a resizeable window.
  10. Removed minimize controls from several modal windows.
  11. A new LLM event has been defined for the [*Reasoning* booster](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Customizing-Assistants#race-spotter) of the Race Spotter. "opponent_pitting" will be signalled, if the direct opponent ahead or behind is going to the pits.
  12. The LLM action "update_strategy" for the [*Reasoning* booster](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Customizing-Assistants#race-strategist) of the Race Strategist has been extended. If the new optional lap number is supplied, the Strategist checks whether a pitstop at a given lap might be beneficial and is also allowed for the currently active strategy.
  13. [Experts] Events for the *Reasoning* booster can now also be raised for other Assistants. This opens up complete new possibilities, so that the Assistants can collaborate on a given task thereby creating complex chain of thoughts. See the updated information about *Assistant.Raise* in the [documentation for event management](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Customizing-Assistants#managing-events).
  14. [Experts] A new method has been introduced to customize the Assistant rules by placing rule snippets in an extension folder. See the [updated documentation](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Rule-Engine#customizing-the-assistant-rules) for more information.

When set to other than "Circuit", track mapping will create a non-closed track. In this case, mapping of the track will start immediately, when the car moves for the first time and will stop, when the car stops. See the new [documentation](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/AI-Race-Spotter#track-types) for more information.
  6. The documentation for [Track Automations](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/AI-Race-Spotter#track-automations) has been extended to reflect the new "Speech" and "Audio" actions, which can be used to create pace notes and other acoustical hints for open tracks.
  7. Automatic track mapping can now be enabled or disabled in various ways, whichever suits your working style best. Default is "On" as before, but this is helpful, if the starting procedure of a non-circuit track requires to roll forward into the starting box.
     - The Tray menu of the "Simulator Controller" background process now contains an item for *Track Mapping*.
     - New controller action ["TrackMapping"](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Plugins-&-Modes#plugin-race-spotter) for the Race Spotter plugin, which toggles the track mapping on / off.

	 - Track mapping can also be enabled ot disabled in the Startup Profiles.
	 - New icon in the Stream Deck icon set for the "TrackMapping" action.
  8. The key combination to request an unblocking of all executables in "Simulator Startup" has changed from Ctrl-Shift to Ctrl-Alt.
  9. A new LLM event has been defined for the [*Reasoning* booster](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Customizing-Assistants#race-spotter) of the Race Spotter. "blue_flag_alert" will be signalled, once a faster car appears in the mirror, that is at least one lap ahead. Revisit your event configuration, include the new events and define actions (for example flash a red light in your dashboard using SimHub, for example), if necessary.
  10. Two new [*Conversation* booster actions](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Customizing-Assistants#race-spotter) have been defined, that can start and stop the track mapping by voice command.
  11. Several new LLM events for the [*Reasoning* booster](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Customizing-Assistants#race-spotter) of the Race Spotter support detection of pitstops, the last lap and also the end of the session.
  12. Vulkan driver support for non-Nvidia GPUs has been added to the local LLM Runtime. Please take a look at the [Update Notes](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Update-Notes#release-584) for more information, since a conflict with CUDA drivers on Nvidia GPUs is possible.
  13. Several updates for the Spanish translation.

     - "ahead_gap_update" and "behind_gap_update" are signalled whenever the gap to the car behind or ahead changed by a given amount (according to the configration in the "Session Database").
	 - "attack_imminent" is signalled when an opponent has closed in and an attack might happen soon.
	 
	 The corresponding [documentation](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Customizing-Assistants#events-2) has been updated.
  9. The "Load Session..." menu command in the "Practice Center" and in the "Race Center" now opens a specialized browser which allows you to search for sessions in the session database. This browser also can open the standard file dialog to load sessions which were stored outside the session database. See the [updated documentation](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Solo-Center#saving-and-loading-sessions) for more information.
  
     Note: To load a session that has been saved in the old, directory-based format prior to Release 5.8.1, hold down the Control key and click on the "Import..." button.

  6. A new Assistant Booster has been implemented, which let you integrate an LLM into the reasoning process of an Assistant.
	 - This *Reasoning* booster can use a different GPT service and LLM than the other conversation-related Assistant Boosters.
     - Events raised by the rule system of an Assistant or by rules defined on your own can be used to create a request to an LLM.
	 - The LLM then can use any of the predefined actions or actions defined on your own to handle this event or situation.
	 - Actions triggered this way can raise other events, thereby creating a complex chain of thought for the LLM.
  7. A new syntax-coloring editor for source code has been implemented and is used in the Assistant Booster dialog when rules are being edited.
  8. Large parts of the documentation have been revised, updated and restructured:
     - The documentation for the "Session Database" has been moved to a separate [documentation chapter](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Session-Database).
     - The documentation for "Strategy Workbench" has been moved to a separate [documentation chapter](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Strategy-Workbench).

     - All new complete documentation of the builtin [Hybrid Rule Engine](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Rule-Engine).
  9. The transcript of LLM invocations in any Assistant Booster now includes the events raised and actions invoked. Transcripts of Assistant Boosters are normally stored in the *Simulator Controller\Logs* folder, which is located in the user *Documents* folder.
  10. The available color schemes has been revised and a new dark color scheme has been added. Four color schemes ae now available:
      - Classic (default, the original color scheme of Simulator Controller)
	  - Gray (formerly named "Dark")
	  - Light (formerly named "Windows", uses the default Windows colors)
	  - Dark (new, uses the dark theme colors of Windows 10 / 11)
	  
	  See the updated [documentation](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Using-Simulator-Controller#color-schemes) for some examples.
  11. A new [controller action functions "speak"](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Installation-&-Configuration#actions) allows you to output spoken messages from your controller scripts.
  12. A new [controller action functions "play"](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Installation-&-Configuration#actions) allows you to play sound files from your controller scripts.
  13. "speak" and "play" has been added to the [location specific actions](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Session-Database#track-&-automation) in Track Automation, which let's you put out a spoken message or play a sound file at a given track location. Rally support is coming...
  14. The automated update procedure now asks before a non-release version is installed.
  15. [Internal] Implemented a postprocessor for the compiler which compresses the binary files. The applications are much smaller now.
  16. [Internal] Migrated to AHK 2.1-alpha.14 (needed for dark color scheme).
  17. [Developer] A new class library (*LLMAgent*) supports a full recursive round-trip between the rule engine and an associated LLM. Using this architecture, fully autonomous agents can be configured.
  18. [Developer] A new class library (*CodeEditor*) integrates the "SciTex" editor with an easy to use programming interface.

  11. The "Plan Pitstop" conversation action for the Race Engineer now lso allows to call for a driver swap in team races.
  12. Two [predefined conversation actions](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/AI-Race-Spotter#trigger-actions-from-conversation) for the Spotter are now available:
      - The LLM can decide to reset and recalculate the delta and lap time history for all cars.
	  - And you can ask the LLM to reset the reference speed data of all cars around the track, when too many false positives for accidents and slow cars are given.
  13. [Expert only] All definition files for "Simulator Setup" can be *overwritten* in the *Simulator Controller\Setup\Definitions* folder which is located in your user *Documents* folder. This can be used to introduce new bundled applications or to replace the startup video, just to name two examples.

## 5.7.6.0-release 06/14/24
  1. Minor bugfixes, as always
  2. Documentation updates here and there, as always
  3. Fixed the lap time comparison information of the Spotter in multiclass races. A bug resulted in a comparison of cars from different classes which resulted in very confusing information.
  4. The default instructions of the Conversation Booster has been updated again to improve conversation quality further. Please see the Update Notes, if you have modified these instructions.
  5. The LLMs used to boost the conversation capabilities of the Assistants are now allowed to trigger some actions as a result of your interaction. A few [actions](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Customizing-Assistants#predefined-actions--events) already have been defined for the Engineer and the Strategist with more to come in the next releases. Using actions, it is possible to define new voice commands, but the LLMs are also allowed to trigger the actions based on the current situation and data constellation.
  
     Please note, that using *Actions* is not enabled by default, but must be explicitly activated in the configuration.
  6. Action definition files are customizeable in the [Documents]\Simulator Controller\Actions folder.
  7. An editor has been implemented to enable or disable the predefined *Conversation* or *Behavior* actions and even define your own ones. But this will require extensive knowledge of the inner workings of Simulator Controller and the Assistants and also a very good understanding how LLMs work. You have been warned. Please see the new [documentation](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Customizing-Assistants#managing-actions) for more information.

Please also take a look at the [Update Notes](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Update-Notes#release-576), if you have configured the Conversation Booster for the Assistants.

## 5.7.5.0-release 06/07/24
  1. Minor bugfixes, as always
  2. Documentation updates here and there, as always
  3. Fixed a bug in "Simulator Setup", which prevented additional software to be located in the "Applications" step.
  4. Fixed voice test button on the main voice control page in "Simulator Setup".
  5. Fixed the "Always" activation mode in "Recognition" Booster.
  6. Cleanup of the additional software supported in "Simulator Setup":
     - Removed "Voice Macro", since it was needed anymore for a long time now.
	 - Added "Real Head Motion" as optional software, since it is one of the most useful extensions for *Assetto Corsa Competizione*.
  7. Automatic updates from versions prior to 5.0.0 are no longer supported.
  8. Added mounted tyre compound to tyres info component in "System Monitor".
  9. The "Telemetry" instruction has been removed for both the Driving Coach and the Conversation Booster. It has been substituted by the new "Knowledge" instruction. This instruction provides the knowledge of a given Assistant now in JSON format to the LLM, which results in a much better understanding of the state of the car, strategy, standings and other important information by the LLM. The [documentation](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Installation-&-Configuration#boosting-conversation-with-an-llm) has been updated accordingly.
  10. The Engineer will provide full pitstop history to the LLM. Questions like: "What were the ambient temperatures at the third pitstop and what tyre pressures did we use then?" will be possible now.
  11. The Spotter now also provides his knowledge about all opponents and the current race situation to the connected LLM, if a "Conversation" booster has been configured.
  12. The Strategist and the Spotter learned a new [voice command](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Race-Strategist-Commands-(EN)). With this you can ask, how often an opponent has been to the pits already.
  13. [Internal] Migrated to AHK 2.0.17.
  14. [Developer] Added mounted tyre compound to the ["Session State.json"](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Plugins-&-Modes#plugin-integration) file.

Please also take a look at the [Update Notes](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Update-Notes#release-575), especially if you have configured and are using the Driving Coach.

## 5.7.4.0-release 05/31/24
  1. Minor bugfixes, as always
  2. Documentation updates here and there, as always
  3. Added support for single word driver names in Team Server and all management applications.
  4. The Assistants no longer react, when the *Push-To-Talk* button was pressed, but nothing was said.
  5. Fixed default service URL for GPT4All.
  6. Adopted *GPT4All* 2.8 API. Should be running stable now in all situations.
  7. The Conversation Booster no longer consume a voice command, when the invoked GPT service does not returned a valid result.
  8. LLMs sometimes use markdown syntax in their answers. Most of this syntactical elements are now removed, so that they do not interfere with the spoken words.
  9. [*Ollama*](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/AI-Driving-Coach#ollama) has been added to the list of supported GPT service providers. This is a GPT server, which can be installed on the local PC.
  10. A [*Generic*](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/AI-Driving-Coach#generic) GPT service provider is now also available. This supports HTTP based GPT services, which implements the OpenAI JSON protocol.
  11. The list of available LLMs is now automatically loaded from a GPT service provider (if supported) in the configuration dialogs.
  12. Increased timeout for GPT service requests to 60 seconds, so that even very slow models have a chance to complete their task.
  13. [Internal] Migrated to AHK 2.0.16.
  
## 5.7.3.0-release 05/24/24
  1. Minor bugfixes, as always
  2. Documentation updates here and there, as always
  3. The translations for checkable menu items has been fixed in several applications.
  4. Several translation errors for the Spanish language has been fixed.
  5. The cold target tyre pressure information in the pitstop component on the session info page in "System Monitor" has been fixed. This bug was introduced with the 5.7.2.
  6. The announcement of chosen tyre pressures by the Engineer in team sessions has been fixed. This bug was introduced with the 5.7.2.
  7. Fixed unwanted automatic re-enabling of simulators and applications by "Simulator Setup" when using the Basic configuration step.
  8. Fixed unwanted automatic re-enabling of "Start with Windows" by "Simulator Setup" when using the Basic configuration step.
  9. Fixed an edge case in "Race Center", where pitstop settings initialization failed after an unplanned pitstop had become necessary after a start incident.
  10. The handling of remote server timeouts has been improved in team sessions. The applications like "Race Center" do not wait anymore in cases of non-important data.
  11. Pressing *Push-To-Talk* without saying anything no longer triggers an "I don't understand, please repeat" answer by the Assistants, as long as you are using Azure or Google for voice recognition.
  12. The Spotter now informs you during qualification whether the car before or behind you is on a valid or on an invalid lap.
  13. It is now possible to configure the instructions for the different GPT-based Conversation Boosters. Please take a look at the [updated documentation](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Installation-&-Configuration#boosting-conversation-with-an-llm) for more information.
  14. The default instructions for the Conversation Boosters has been extended to include more personality and domain specific behaviour. A full overview for all supported instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Installation-&-Configuration#boosting-conversation-with-an-llm).
  15. Many more announcements and messages by the Spotter can now be rephrased by the Conversation Booster. Only very urgent messages like proximity alerts are excluded, because of the additional latency introduced when calling a GPT service.
  16. The default "Character" instruction for the Driving Coach has been updated. Therefoe all instructions will be reset to their defaults. This is only necessary this time, see next item.
  17. A method has been introduced, that checks whether you are using the default instructions for an LLM, so that you don't need to update them, when they have changed in the distribution package.
  18. It is now possible to manage teams, driver and sessions directly from "Simulator Startup", if you are using the Team Server. Please see the new [documentation](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Using-Simulator-Controller#team-management) for more information.
  19. Renamed the "Team Server" tab in "Simulator Configuration" to "Team Management". Using this tab is not necessary anymore and it will eventually be removed, since the functionality is now provided from within "Simulator Startup".
  20. [*OpenRouter*](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/AI-Driving-Coach#openrouter) has been added to the list of supported GPT service providers.
  21. The documentation has been updated to cover the [configuration requirements](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/AI-Driving-Coach#installation) for the added GPT providers.
  
Please also take a look at the [Update Notes](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Update-Notes#release-573), especially if you have configured and are using the Driving Coach.

## 5.7.2.0-release 05/17/24
  1. Minor bugfixes, as always
  2. Documentation updates here and there, as always
  3. Fixed automatic installation of the French language pack for voice recognition by "Simulator Setup".
  4. Fixed calculation of remaining stint time, if driver time is less than stint time.
  5. The configuration of the *Push-To-Talk* button now supports a test mode, which starts two Assistants, so that you can play with the *Push-To-Talk* button. Depending on the chosen recognizer it might be necessary to use the double-press for activation commands, when using the test mode (see [here](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Using-Simulator-Controller#activation-commands-vs-normal-commands) for more information).
  6. The Driving Coach now also has access to the car telemetry data from the general knowledge base. It therefore is theoretically able to correlate degrading lap times with over the top tyre temperatures, for example.
  7. The default context window size for an LLM has been increased to 2k tokens in the Driving Coach configuration.
  8. The next feature of the AI-based booster for the Assistants now integrates a general conversation capability. Every voice command, that cannot be matched against the list of predefined, pattern-based commands, will be forwarded to the GPT service for a general conversation. The LLM has full access to the knowledge base of the Assistant, incl. telemetry data, standings and position data, and so on. The exact knowledge will vary with the type of the Assistant (Engineer, Strategist, ...). See the [extended documentation](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Installation-&-Configuration#boosting-conversation-with-an-llm) for more information.
  9. Configuration of the Conversation Booster is now also possible using "Simulator Configuration". See the [updated documentation](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Installation-&-Configuration#tab-plugins) for more information.
  10. [*Mistral AI*](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/AI-Driving-Coach#mistral-ai) has been added to the list of supported GPT service providers.
  11. Added "GPT 4o" to the list of OpenAI models.
  12. The pitstop component on the session info page of "System Monitor" now also displays the relative tyre pressure increment values for the next pitstop.
  13. [Internal] Migrated to AHK 2.0.15.
  14. [Developer] Add information about tyre pressure increment values to the ["Session State.json"](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Plugins-&-Modes#plugin-integration) file.

## 5.7.1.0-release 05/10/24
  1. Minor bugfixes, as always
  2. Documentation updates here and there, as always
  3. Fixed saving of probability setting for rephrasing for the Assistant Booster.
  4. Improved meta data handling for Assistant Booster. All instructions to the LLM are now kept in an instructions file and can be modified or extended by the user.
  5. Once again some tweaking for accident detection by the Spotter.
  6. Tweaked lap time delta calculation after collecting damage.
  7. Fixed a couple of Strategist command patterns.
  8. Deferred the call to pit by the Engineer, so that it is not issued, before the pitstop settings has been set up.
  9. The Engineeer now informs about pressure changes incrementally if tyre compound is unchanged.
  10. Added new Ford Mustang for *Assetto Corsa Competizione*.
  11. The AI-based booster for the Assistants now also support semantic understanding of comannds, for which no pattern has been defined in the grammars of the Assistant. See the [revised documentation](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Installation-&-Configuration#boosting-conversation-with-an-llm) of the Assistant Booster for more information. The configuration of the speech improvement is available on the "Basic" setup page of "Simulator Setup".
  12. [Internal] Migrated to AHK 2.0.14.
  13. New car models for "Setup Workbench":
      - Assetto Corsa Competizione
        - Ford Mustang GT3

## 5.7.0.2-release 05/06/24
  1. Second and most probably final fix for the Team Server / "Race Center" bug mentioned below.
  
## 5.7.0.1-release 05/05/24
  1. Hopefully fixed a critical bug for Team Server / "Race Center", which prevented transfer of session state from one driver to the other when Assistants are set to silent in the startup settings.
  
## 5.7.0.0-release 05/03/24
  1. Minor bugfixes, as always
  2. Documentation updates here and there, as always
  3. The new setting "Spotter: Threshold for Overtaking car ahead" in the [settings](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Session-Settings) in the "Session Database" can be used to specify the time gap to a car ahead or behind, in which the Spotter does not issue any additional information about your opponent. This can prevent the Spotter telling you to overtake, while you are actually started doing exactly that.
  4. Rearranged the priority of a couple of information announcements of the Spotter to make them more relevant and timely.
  5. Fine-tuning for some edge cases in the accident detection on tracks with extreme braking zones.
  6. The default models for OpenAI has been updated, since OpenAi introduced new models (always difficult to keep up with them). This relates to the Driving Coach configuration and also to the new speech improvement capabilities (see next topic). You may want to review your choice and update your model reference to the newest version, since they might even be cheaper.
  7. "Simulator Setup" now supports configuration of LLM-based post-prcessing and rephrasing of voice messages issued by the Assistants. This is the first step in a series of enhancements for the Engineer, the Strategist and the Spotter using GPT technology. All this enhancements will be optional, since they either require a very powerful PC to run an LLM locally or you must buy some computing time from companies like OpenAI. Although very inexpensive, this is also not for everybody. Please take a look at the new [documentation](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Installation-&-Configuration#boosting-conversation-with-an-llm).
  8. [Developer] Added a first GPT-based speech post-processor in preparation for the new Assistant GPT architecture. This post processor uses an LLM to randomly rephrase each message issued by the Assistants to bring in more variations. It can also be used to translate between different languages as long as the used LLM supports this.
  
Please also take a look at the [Update Notes](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Update-Notes#release-570), especially if you have configured and are using the Driving Coach.

## 5.6.8.0-release 04/26/24
  1. Minor bugfixes, as always
  2. Documentation updates here and there, as always
  3. The appearance of checkable menu items have been changed in many applications. It is now much more clear, wether a given menu item is a toggle switch.
  4. Two new options "Auto Clear" and "Auto Export" in the "Session" menu of the "Practice Center" let you specify the behaviour, when a new session is started or the application is closed with some unsaved / unexported data still present.
  5. A [new info component](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Using-Simulator-Controller#monitoring-health-and-activities) for the "System Monitor" supplies extensive information about car damages collected in previous in incidents. The information provided depends on the capabilities and the supplied data by the given simulator, though.
  6. The same informmation of the new damage info component is supplied in the ["Session State.json" file](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Plugins-&-Modes#plugin-integration) generated by the ["Integration"  plugin](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Plugins-&-Modes#plugin-integration).
  7. The warnings issued by the Spotter for unsafe drivers have been optimized. The threshold of cuts and off-tracks is now dynamic and the warning has been rephrased.
  8. Added support for logical key mapping of third party tools like Joy2Key.
  9. [Internal] Migrated to AHK 2.0.13.
  10. [Developer] Added a new generic class library for LLM support in preparation for the new Assistant GPT architecture.

## 5.6.7.0-release 04/19/24
  1. Minor bugfixes, as always
  2. Documentation updates here and there, as always
  3. Fixed a bug in "Simulator Setup", where simulator localization on the basic setup page did not work.
  4. The "NextPitstop" action of the Race Strategist will ask for confirmation before instructing the Engineer even in full autonomous mode.
  5. The active startup profile is now displayed below the startup button in "Simulator Startup".
  6. The Spotter now starts track mapping immediately after the end of the first lap.
  7. Finished sessions will stay at least a week untouched on the Team Server.
  8. Removed "Save Session" from "Race Center" and "Practice Center", which was confusing to many users. You now always save a copy to your local hard drice.
  9. Again some accident detection tweaks for the Spotter
  10. Replays in iRacing will now pause the telemetry acquisition.
  11. The data on the session info page in the "System Monitor" will now be as correct as possible also in team races, even when one or more Assistants are not active for a given driver.
  12. The frequency of information and advice callouts can now be configured for the Race Spotter. Please see the [revised documentation](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Installation-&-Configuration#tab-race-spotter) for more information.
  13. A new mode for the opponent information of the Spotter allows to get information not only at sector boundaries. Very useful for very long tracks like the Nordschleife, when used together with the aforementioned update frequency.
  14. Adjusted some field and box sizes in "Simulator Setup" and "Simulator Configuration".
  15. A small fix for the Team Server extends the life time of finished sessions.
  
Please also take a look at the [Update Notes](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Update-Notes#release-567), especially if you are running your own Team Server.

## 5.6.6.0-release 04/12/24
  1. Minor bugfixes, as always
  2. Documentation updates here and there, as always
  3. Shared database synchronization is back to operation.
  4. The setting "Spotter: Car Indicator" in the [settings](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Session-Settings) in the "Session Database" has now a third choice "Both", which let the Spotter refer to a car by race number and current position at the same time.
  5. The setting "Car Indicator" is also available for the Strategist now.
  6. Once again some tweaks for the accident detection and alerting by the Spotter.
  7. *iRacing* practice sessions, where sometimes the lap counter jumps directly to lap 2, are now detected correctly.
  8. Offline "Test Drives" are now treated as practice sessions in *iRacing*.
  9. The detection speed of controller trigger (buttons, dials, and so on) has been greatly increased. Dials are now also detected very reliable and fast.
  10. Key presses on the keyboard are now also detected during trigger detection in "Simulator Setup" and "Simulator Configuration".
  11. The hotkey string (e.g. 2Joy7 or <^<!A) for a detected trigger is now placed in the clipboard for further usage.
  12. The Trigger Detector Tool is now also available when building [Track Automations](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/AI-Race-Spotter#track-automations).
  13. Added "24H Nürburgring" to the track name file for *Assetto Corsa Competizione*.

## 5.6.5.0-release 04/05/24
  1. Minor bugfixes, as always
  2. Documentation updates here and there, as always
  3. Fixed a bug in all applications sometime popping up a crash info dialog for a fraction of a second, when the PC is shutdown (Windows 11).
  4. Introduced special error handling in the Stream Deck plugin, that can prevent crashing during Windows 11 system shutdown.
  5. A lot of fine-tuning for the accident detection to further reduce false positves. Statistical methods are now used to remove invalid data points.
  6. Accident detection now also supports Big Grid sessions in *Assetto Corsa Competizione*.
  7. The precision for the accident detection on very long tracks has been improved significantly (Nordschleife).
  8. Fixed a recurring bug in the transfer of pitstop settings in *rFactor 2*.
  9. The dashboard widgets on the first page of the "System Monitor" now resize correctly when the window is enlarged.
  10. The automatic pre-selction of the last used track has been fixed for the "Setup Workbench".

Please also take a look at the [Update Notes](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Update-Notes#release-565), if you are using Stream Deck.

## 5.6.4.0-release 03/29/24
  1. Minor bugfixes, as always
  2. Documentation updates here and there, as always
  3. Fixed a regression introduced with 5.6.3.2 which prevented the race start reported correctly by the Spotter in some situations.
  4. Fixed a bug in the Spanish voice recognition.
  5. Fixed periodic update of the track map in "Race Center".
  6. Fixed "Simulator Setup" to include *Le Mans Ultimate* on the simulation configuration page.
  7. Fixed car positions in race reports as well as in "Race Center" and "Practice Center" for *iRacing* online races.
  8. A memory leak in the *iRacing* data connector has been fixed.
  9. A rare bug has been fixed in the "Track Mapper", which prevented a track map to be calculated correctly, when one of the GPS coordinates were zero for the X value.
  10. It is now detected correctly in *iRacing* whether the drivers car is in the pit for service.
  11. It is also detected correctly in *iRacing* now whether any car is in the pitlane.
  12. Invalid laps for any driver are now detected for *iRacing*. But it depends on the data update frequency set in the "Session Database", whether this detection is reliable, since the iRacing API only signals an invalid lap as long as the car is off-track.
  13. The default for the setting "Engineer: Tyre Service" is now used correctly for *iRacing*, where it is *False* (Off), since *iRacing* does not report valid hot tyre pressures most of the time.
  14. Changing of tyre compounds are now supported during pitstops in *iRacing*:
      - New action "TyreCompound" for the ["IRC" plugin](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Plugins-&-Modes#plugin-irc).
	  - Support added in "Simulator Setup" to configure this action.
	  - Stream Deck icon is available for the "TyreCompound" action.
	  - The Race Engineer is fully aware of the configured tyre compounds for a given car.
  15. "Practice Center" now informs about unsaved data before starting a new session.
  16. Updated car meta data for *RaceRoom Racing Experience* to the latest version.
  17. [Accident and slow car detection](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/AI-Race-Spotter#accident-detection-for-assetto-corsa-competizione) by the Spotter is now also available for *Assetto Corsa Competizione*.
  18. [Internal] Migrated to AHK version 2.0.12.

**Important:** The accident detection has seen many changes since its initial release with 5.6.3. The current algorithms rely heavily on learning the track layout, the ideal line and the typical speeds during the initial laps. Unfortunately, the initial laps also see many accidents in some races, which can lead to false positives further down the road. I have included additional code which tries to detect and correct this, but it does not work all the time yet. If you encounter many false warnings like "Slow car ahead in 200 meters." by the Spotter during a race, although there is no such slow car, you can then disable the warnings by using the voice command:

	No more *warning*, please.
	
Use one of "slow car warnings", "ahead accidents warnings", "behind accidents information" for *warning* as required. If this is not usable for you, you can also disable the accident warnings completely in the configuration for important races for now.

Please also take a look at the [Update Notes](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Update-Notes#release-564), if you are running *iRacing* and want to use the new "TyreCompound" action.

## 5.6.3.2-release 03/17/24
  1. Fixed a critical bug in "Race Center" which caused standings information only being loaded for the starting driver.

## 5.6.3.1-release 03/16/24
  1. Fixed a critical bug in the Spotter for iRacing which prevented proper startup in some cases.

## 5.6.3.0-release 03/15/24
  1. Minor bugfixes, as always
  2. Documentation updates here and there, as always
  3. Fixed definition of custom tyre compound rules in "Session Database".
  4. Fixed occasional Spotter crashes for *RaceRoom Racing Experience*.
  5. Fixed telemetry analyzation by the Driving Coach for *RaceRoom Racing Experience* and *iRacing*.
  6. Fixed standings information for *iRacing*.
  7. It is now possible to disable automated pitstop handling for *iRacing* similar to the other simulators. Please take a look at the [revised documentation](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Plugins-&-Modes#mode-pitstop-2).
  8. A new customization method allows to introduce support for user specific applications in "Simulator Setup".
  9. The minimum window height of "Simulator Setup" has been increased.
  10. The Strategist (or the Engineer, when the Strategist is disabled) will now inform you immediately, when you started into a race on a wrong tyre compound. No support for automated pitstop or strategy updates will be given, only the information. You won't start a race on wrong tyres, won't you?
  11. The Spotter can now inform about accidents and slow cars ahead and also about accidents behind. The Spotter will learn the track layout and the typical speed and position of a car at each part of the track during the first few laps. When one or more cars are way slower or are at positions far away from the ideal line, this will be counted as an accident.
      - The support for these alerts vary between the different simulators. Be sure to check out the [revised documentation](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/AI-Race-Spotter#alerts--information).
      - "Simulator Configuration" and "Simulator Setup" has been extended to allow enabling / disabling of the new alerts.
      - The announcements voice command of the Spotter has been extended to allow to enable / disable the new alerts while driving. Example: ["Please no more slow car warnings"](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Race-Strategist-Commands-(EN)).
      - New settings for the Spotter in the [settings](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Session-Settings) in the "Session Database" allow you to configure the distance before and behind the car, for which the traffic should be analyzed for accidents.
      - Please note that both *Assetto Corsa Competizione* and in parts also *iRacing* do not support accident detection yet for different reasons. Support will be added with future releases.
  12. Initial support for rain and wet tracks for iRacing. Not everything is working yet, since the iRacing API extensions are still under development. The system will get smarter with each season patch being rolled out.
      - Tyre compound information for the currently mounted tyres as well as the tyre compounds selected for the next pitstop are already available. Make sure to read at least the new documentation about [tyre compound handling in iRacing](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Tyre-Compounds#special-notes-for-iracing).
      - The current weather will be correct in most cases, only fixed weather seams to be making problems. Unfortunately iRacing does not provide any information about the future weather yet. Therefore, the Assistants cannot plan for or even announce upcoming weather changes. But they will react immediately when the weather change happens.
      - The code for handling the grip level of the track is working and will cover the full range from "Optimum" to "Flooded".
      - Changing the tyre compound during a pitstop is not supported yet by the iRacing API at the moment. This will be added with a later release.

  1. Minor bugfixes, as always
  2. Documentation updates here and there, as always
  3. Fixed import of (race) settings in the "Session Database".
  4. Fixed export of (race) settings in the "Session Database" in case the Ctrl key is NOT held down.
  5. Fixed several grammar glitches in the Spotter phrases for the French language.
  6. All already completed pitstops will be taken into account when it comes to race rules validation, when a strategy is being re-calculated by the Strategist or in the "Race Center".
  7. The pitstop window and also the "Required" refueling and "Required" tyre change now only relate to the required pitstops.
  8. The reliability of the pitstop information of all opponents has been increased in the "Race Center".
  9. It is now possible to choose how the Spotter refers to a specific vehicle, like "Car number 7 had a problem" or "The car in P 5 had a problem". A new setting had been introduced in the [settings](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Session-Settings) in the "Session Database". Default is indication by position.
  10. The Spotter now can interrupt itself, when a more urgent information must be communicated, for example when he is informing the driver about the lap time of an opponent and an attack happens from behind.
  11. Parsing of the car name has been improved for *Le Mans Ultimate* - race numbers and cup category will be detected.
  12. If duplicate race numbers are detected in *rFactor 2* or *Le Mans Ultimate*, synthetical race numbers starting from **1** will be used instead. This will fix many internal problems with race standings, race reports, and so on. Please note, that the Assistants will also use these synthetical race numbers when refering to cars, which will make it difficult for you to name a specific car by voice command in this case. But it was a problem anyway with the duplicate numbers before.
  13. [Experts Only] Team specific settings can now be assembled by a team manager and can be imported by every team member using a special preset in "Simulator Setup". Please take a look at the [new documentation](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Using-Simulator-Controller#managing-common-team-settings) for more information how to assemble such a package.
  14. [Experts Only] Special logging has been implemented which helps tracking down startup performance problems. It can be activated in the [core settings](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Core-Configuration).

## 5.6.1.0-release 03/01/24
  1. Minor bugfixes, as always
  2. Documentation updates here and there, as always
  3. Fixed a bug in the "Practice Center" that prevented tyre pressures to be displayed in the *Laps* list, when a session is loaded after being saved to disk.
  4. Fixed a bug for *rFactor 2* which prevented tyre pressures to be initialized correctly during pitstop automation.
  5. Fixed a bug in strategy simulation, which in rare cases caused failures when re-calculating a strategy using traffic scenarios in the "Race Center" or by the Strategist.
  6. Integrated support for *Le Mans Ultimate*:
     - [New plugin "LMU"](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Plugins-&-Modes#plugin-lmu), which provides the same level of integration and similar controller actions as the "RF2" plugin for *rFactor 2*.
	 - Full support in "Simulator Setup" to configure the "LMU" plugin.
	 - Take a look [here](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Installation-&-Configuration#installation-of-telemetry-providers) for more information on how to install and configure the data integration plugin (*rFactor2SharedMemoryMapPlugin64.dll*) in the *Le Mans Ultimate* installation directory.
	 - *Le Mans Ultimate* is still under heavy development. Although it uses the same engine as *rFactor 2*, it looks like that several aspects of the shared memory API have changed. This is what has been achieved so far and what is not working:
	   - General telemetry is working
       - Pressures, temperatures, and so on are all there
	   - Car positions and timings also
       - The standings information seems to be broken in the API
	   - Driver names sometimes contain glitch characters; looks like an 8bit / 16bit charset bug
	   - Car names do not contain the model of the car, but the name of the team and other weird stuff
	   - Pitstop data input (normally a strength of the *rFactor 2* API) is not working at all
  
Please also take a look at the [Update Notes](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Update-Notes#release-561), if you are running *Le Mans Ultimate* and want to activate the integration for this title.

## 5.6.0.1-release 02/23/24
  1. Fixed a critical bug when save strategies with tyre set information.

## 5.6.0.0-release 02/23/24
  1. Minor bugfixes, as always
  2. Documentation updates here and there, as always
  3. Fixed auto stint creation in "Practice Center", when a *normal* pitstop has been performed without a tyre change in any type of session.
  4. Fixed reporting of incidents and damage by the Engineer in the first lap, if the configured number of learning laps is equal to 1.
  5. New functions are available in the Startup Profiles and the corresponding documentation has been extended with an [overview](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Using-Simulator-Controller#startup-profiles) of all available functions.
  6. Race settings can now be exported and imported in the "Session Database". See the [revised documentation](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Session-Database#settings) for more information.
  7. The consumption option has been removed from the optimizer in "Strategy Workbench". The main idea behind this option was to lower the fuel consumption a little bit, for example, when the driver implements a lift and coast driving style, but the results were not convincing.
  8. You now have fine-grained control over the length of the first and also the length of the last stint in the strategy simulation. See the [revised documentation](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Strategy-Workbench#simulation) for more information.
  9. And you can vary the fuel amount added at a pitstop to some extent in the strategy simulation. This is helpful to reduce the car weight over the full race and even out the stint lengths in cases where otherwise a short last stint would have been used. See the [revised documentation](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Strategy-Workbench#simulation) for more information.
  10. The regular pitstop window is now a separate entry in the pitstop rules in the "Strategy Workbench". You now can have 2 required pitstops in this window, for example.
  11. There is a new tab "Pitstops (fixed)" available in the "Strategy Workbench", which allows you to fix the lap for one or more pitstops during strategy simulation. But there are some drawbacks, so read the [new documentation](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/AI-Race-Strategist#pitstops-fixed) carefully.
  12. The strategy simulation in the "Strategy Workbench" and the "Race Center" and also, when run by the Race Strategist, now keep track of tyre usage for all tyre sets. Tyre sets will appropriately be re-used in sessions with a restricted number of tyre sets and the strategy simulation will try to optimize the overall utilization of tyre sets for the whole session.
  13. Tyre set numbers are displayed in the strategy summary report in the "Strategy Workbench" and also in the "Race Center".
  14. For sessions with a fixed time, the strategy report now displays the full session time (enclosed in paranthesis) in the "Duration" field of the report.
  15. The strategy chart (fuel and tyre diagram) can now also be displayed in the upper area of the "Strategy Workbench". Choose "Strategy" from the "Chart" drop down menu located above the chart area.
  16. Strategy comparison reports now list the strategies in the order form best to worse.
  17. The default for the automatic pressure loss correction is now *Off* in the "Race Center".
  18. Several new RSS Formula cars have been included in the car meta data DLC by @mirko_lesko.
  19. [Experts only] The rules for strategy validation in the "Strategy Workbench" have been revised and extended. Full information about tyre sets are now available for each pitstop. Please see the [revised documentation](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/AI-Race-Strategist#scenario-validation) for more information.
  20. New car models for "Setup Workbench":
      - Assetto Corsa
        - Lotus 72D
        - Lotus 98T
  
Please also take a look at the [Update Notes](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Update-Notes#release-558), if you have defined your own scenario validation rules in the "Strategy Workbench".

  1. Minor bugfixes, as always
  2. Documentation updates here and there, as always
  3. Fixed several bugs for manual adjustments of an already prepared pitstop.
  4. Fixed a bug in the laptime comparison of the Spotter, which resulted in the Spotter reporting driver to be faster although he in fact wasn't.
  5. Fixed a typo for the Alpine A110 GT4 car meta data in ACC. The car now shows up everywhere with its correct long name.
  6. Fixed new CC GT2 car names in those cases when they were driven, before the meta data was already available in Simulator Controller.
  7. Reading the *udpConnection* argument for the "ACC" plugin now ignores errors.
  8. (Re-)Planning a pitstop will now always clear an already prepared pitstop. The settings transferred to the simulator will be preserved, though.
  9. **Important:** In most cases, it is no longer necessary to double-press the Push-To-Talk button to [initiate an activation command](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Using-Simulator-Controller#voice-commands) like "Hey Jona". There is one exception, so please check the [revised documentation](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Using-Simulator-Controller#activation-commands-vs-normal-commands).
  10. The capabilities of the Driving Coach to discuss with you after a session your performance and possible handling issues of the car, has been greatly improved.

  7. The Server URL drop down list does not jump to the first entry anymore in "Simulator Configuration", when a previously unknown URL has been entered.
  8. When a session database is being rebuild by the "Database Synchronizer", no more duplicate objects are created on the Team Server.
  9. The "Database Synchronizer" has become much more resilient against corrupted data in the local database.
  10. Handling and performance of background processes has been optimized for "Simulator Setup".
  11. The lap time of the first lap of a stint is now ignored in all computations of "Race Center" and "Practice Center".
  12. Downloadable components are now available as presets in "Simulator Setup". See the [revised documentation](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Installation-&-Configuration#presets--special-configurations) for more information how to use the DLCs.

See the all new [documentation](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Using-Simulator-Controller#startup-profiles) for more information.
  10. New [control key modifiers](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Keyboard-Modifiers) for "Simulator Startup" allow you to quickly open the startup profiles editor and run the startup process automatically when closing the editor. Some of the former keyboard modifiers for "Simulator Startup" have changed, therefore take a close look at the [list of modifiers](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Keyboard-Modifiers).
  11. Some presets, that were used to disable voice handling completely or to start the Assistants muted, has been deprecated in "Simulator Setup".

## 5.5.1.0-release 12/15/23
  1. Minor bugfixes, as always
  2. Documentation updates here and there, as always
  3. The automatic updater now checks, whether the update was successful for all files. A warning is emitted, if any files had been skipped, for example, because they are in use by another software at the time of the update.
  4. The "Edit Labels & Icons..." button is now also available on the simulators page in "Simulator Setup".
  5. The actions to select the front and rear brake pads for service has been added for *Assetto Corsa Competizione* to "Simulator Setup".

  7. The application of the preference slider for an early or a late pitstop has been optimized for the automatic recalculation of a strategy by the Strategist or in the "Race Center".
  8. Fixed an off by one error for the post pitstop tyre set information for *Asseto Corsa Competizione* in "Race Center".
  9. Corrected several values in the *Service* section of the Pitstop report in "Race Center".
  10. Separate values for service time, repairs time and pitlane time loss are now displayed in the Pitstop report in "Race Center".
  11. Many [changes to the pitstop settings](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/AI-Race-Engineer#the-pitstop), that are made using the game controls, will be correctly detected now by the Race Engineer in *rFactor 2*, *Assetto Corsa Competizione* and *iRacing*, as long as a pitstop has been already planned and prepared. The changed settings will be automatically integrated in the active pitstop plan of the Engineer and will also update the planned pitstop in the "Race Center". Exceptions are, for example, the choice of the tyre compound or the repair options in *Assetto Corsa Competizione*, since these values are unfortunately not available in the data API.

  4. The UI translation for the French language has been completed.
  5. A couple of optimizations for the handling of the Pitstop settings in *Assetto Corsa Competizione* has been introduced:
     - Every setting change will now be checked after completion of the setup process. If an unwanted difference is detected, for example, because the driver intervened with the keyboard command input, the desired change is done again.
	 - Unfortunately, *Assetto Corsa Competizione* does not provide the information, which tyre compound is currently selected in the Pitstop MFD in the data API. A new strategy in the option walk will now detect it anyway by checking the availibilty of other settings.
  6. Superfluous proximity alerts for cars that are actually behind a wall and driving in another direction or are not moving at all, are now supressed.
  7. You can now specify [a preference for an early or a late first pitstop](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Strategy-Workbench#simulation), when running a strategy simulation in the "Strategy Workbench".
  8. A runtime for large language models has been integrated into Simulator Controller, which allows you to run a LLM for the "Driving Coach" locally on your PC, without installing additional software or creating an OpenAI account. Please note that this increases the performance and memory requirements for the "Driving Coach" dramatically, but if your PC can handle it, then it is a great alternative to OpenAI and Co. See the new [documentation](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/AI-Driving-Coach#llm-runtime) for more information about the configuration requirements.
  9. New [control key modifiers](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Keyboard-Modifiers) for "Simulator Configuration" and "Simulator Setup" let you decide whether other applications will be terminated before working on the configuration.

     - A new navigation menu at the bottom of the window allows you to go to each configuration step quickly.
	 - You can also always jump to a specific page when "Simulator Setup" is started, by [referencing this page in "Application Settings.ini"](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Installation-&-Configuration#running-the-setup-tool).
     - "Simulator Setup" now supports a kind of quick configuration, which allow especially new users to create a useful configuration very fast. See the extended documentation of the [quick start guide](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Quick-Start-Guide) for more information.
	 - Full configuration of the *Names*, *Languages* and *Voices* of the Race Assistants is now possible in the "Basic" configuration page.
	 - When a new configuration is being created, some of the changes made by the user in other application, for example in the settings of "Simulator Startup", will be preserved, if possible.
	 - The presets "Names and voices of Assistants", "Different Speaker Voices" and "Mode Automation" have been removed, since they are no longer needed. If such a preset is in use in your configuration, it will still be active, until you remove it.
	 - The "Push-To-Talk Behaviour" preset has been deprecated as well. This option is now available in the standard voice control configuration.
	 - All presets with search images for *Assetto Corsa Competizione* has been removed, since they are no longer needed.
	 - [Expert Only] A new preset "Custom Configuration" has been added with a very extensive sample section, which helps the experts to create special configurations.
	 - [Expert Only] When a new configuration is beeing created, "Simulator Setup" will first read the currently active configuration and then will generate the new configuration. The new configuration will then be integrated into the current configuration, preserving in most cases the custom additions, that may have been made with "Simulator Configuration", as long as they are not in conflict or happen to be the same configuration item. This means, that it is now possible to use the wizard "Simulator Setup" together with "Simulator Configuration" for configuration tasks.
  4. "Simulator Startup" learned a new trick. It can now unblock applications and DLLs, when holding down the Control together with the Shift key, while starting. See the [extended documentation](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Using-Simulator-Controller#fixing-problems) for more information.
  5. A fourth page has been added to the "Server Administration" application. This page shows a [list of all data](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Team-Server#server-administration) currently stored on the Team Server and also allows to compact the database, if necessary. This requires a new version of the Team Server. **If you are running your own Team Server, you should update your instance(s).**
  6. The "Practice Center" now shows the sector times, if available from the simulator data API, in the laps list and various reports.
  7. The "Race Center" now shows the sector times, if available from the simulator data API, in the laps list and various reports.
  8. The Race Spotter now compares your pace to the pace of all cars on the grid and informs you from time, whether you are faster than cars that are in positions in front of you.
  9. When you are in close combat with other cars, the Spotter now informs you, in which sectors your opponent is faster or slower than you.
  10. The Race Strategist now understands Full Course Yellow situations and can evaluate, whether a pitstop under FCY might be beneficial:
      - New [voice command "We have Full Course Cellow. Should I come to the pit?"](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Race-Strategist-Commands-(EN)) to ask the Strategist for possible actions under Full Course Yellow.
	  - New controller action ["FCYRecommend"](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Plugins-&-Modes#plugin-race-strategist) for the Race Strategist plugin, which triggers the same.
	  - New icon in the Stream Deck icon set for the "FCYRecommend" action.

  6. An icon has been added to the Stream Deck icon set for the "LapTime" information request action.
  7. *Practice run sheets* have been added to the "Practice Center", which helps you to create telemetry data for special conditions and car setups, for which no data is available yet. See the all new [documentation](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/AI-Race-Strategist#using-the-run-sheet) for more information.
  8. When a stint plan is created or updated in the "Race Center" it now not only includes information from the strategy but also take the already run stints into account, especially for the driver selection of a stint in the stint plan. When a stint plan is already present, driver selection of stints that have not been started will not be overwritten anymore by information from the strategy.
  9. When initializing the settings for the next pitstop in the "Race Center", used tyre sets of past stints will be taken into account and the system tries to [recommend the next fresh tyre set](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Team-Center#planning-a-pitstop). But be sure to double check the recommendation to not end up with worn tyres after your pitstop. This method can be deactivated in the "Pitstop" menu.

  1. Minor bugfixes, as always
  2. Documentation updates here and there, as always
  3. You can now enable an acoustic feedback for Audible feedback in the Telemetry Analyzer. Whenever a handling event is registered (over- or understeering) a short beep of varying pitch and intensity will give you some feedback. See the [revised documentation](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Setup-Workbench#real-time-issue-analyzer) for more information.
  4. [Experts only] It is now possible to define your own modes and layers for Button Boxes.

Please see the [new documentation](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Plugins-&-Modes#configuration-of-custom-modes) for more information.
  5. A new controller action function "mouse" is available, which allows you to send virtual mouse clicks to any application by a button press on your controller.
  6. [Experts only] A new controller action function "call" let's you invoke internal methods for any plugin or the Controller itself.
  7. Fixed a regression introduced in the last release, which disabled the pitstop settings preview window in "Race Center".
  8. A new setting in the [core settings](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Core-Configuration) allows you to set the update frequency for the data transferred to the Team Server in team sessions. The default is an update each 10 seconds and I advise you to only go lower when hosting your own Team Server on a really powerful backend. Going lower on an instance run in the Azure cloud, for example, may stall the server and will increase the running costs at least.
  9. Apps launched from "Simulator Startup" will select the current simulator, car and track a simulation is currently running.
  10. "Race Reports" will now try to open the recently selected simulator, car and track, if no simulation is currently running.
  11. New plugin parameter "openRaceReports" for the ["Race Strategist"](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Plugins-&-Modes#plugin-race-strategist), which let you start the race reports browser from your controller hardware.

  3. Four new widgets are available for the *Session* info page of the "System Monitor". The [corresponding documentation](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Using-Simulator-Controller#monitoring-health-and-activities) has been extended.
  4. The widgets, that will be shown on the *Session* info page of the "System Monitor", can now be [configured individually](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Using-Simulator-Controller#monitoring-health-and-activities).
  5. A couple of new sanity checks has been integrated in "Simulator Setup" to ensure that only correct configurations can be created.
  6. Removed duplicate setting named "Strategy: Pitstop Window" has been removed from the [settings](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Session-Settings) and joined with "Strategy: Pitstop Variation Window (+/- Lap)". Please check your settings in the "Session Database", when you have used these settings.
  7. The Strategist will now only report strategy changes worth to be mentioned. New strategies, where only a small amount of fuel changed (up to half of the safety fuel), will be adopted silently.
  8. The Strategist will give you an even more detailed explanation of strategy differences when a change of strategy is recommended.
  9. The "Race Center" will from now on use values from the current strategy (if any) before taking values from the stint plan into account.
  10. The Spotter no longer will interrupt himself.
  11. Connecting to the Team Server using the Ctrl key works again.

  3. A new page has been added to the "System Monitor", where important [information about the current session](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Using-Simulator-Controller#monitoring-health-and-activities) is displayed. The next release will introduce more widgets for this session dashboard and the possibility to create your own set to be displayed according to your personal preferences and needs.
  4. When automatic strategy revision is enabled for the Strategist and a new strategy is available, you will get an overview about the key facts of the new strategy before you can decide, whether you want to activate it.
  5. It is now possible to enable the [Monte Carlo traffic simulation](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/AI-Race-Strategist#adjusting-the-strategy-during-a-race) method, which has been [available in the "Race Center"](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Team-Center#strategy-handling) for quite some time, for the strategy simulation by the AI Race Strategist as well.
     - New option in ["Race Settings"](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/AI-Race-Strategist#tab-strategy) let you enable / disable the Monte Carlo method.
	 - A couple of [new settings](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Session-Settings) in the "Session Database" allow you to fine tune the behaviour of the probabilistic algorithm.
     Important: Use with caution, since it imposes additional load on the CPU.
  6. A couple of bugs in the Monte Carlo simulation of the "Race Center" has been fixed, which were introduced with version 5.0.
  7. Fixed a rare bug, when the wrong map was selected during strategy simulation.
  8. The pitstop history of all opponent cars will be considered to predict future pitstops in traffic simulations both in the "Race Center" as well as now with the Race Strategist. During the first stint, where no pitstop history is available, a probabilistic model is used as before.
  9. A [new setting](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Session-Settings) is available in the "Session Database" for each Assistant, to enable or disable grouping of voice output. When an Assistant voice output is interrupted, it tries to repeat its message. With the new setting you can choose, whether the whole message with all sentences which belong together or only the last sentence will be repeated.
  10. Handling of missing stint data (due to drivers not connected by intent or unintentionally) in the "Race Center" has been improved.

  1. Minor bugfixes, as always
  2. Documentation updates here and there, as always
  3. You can now set the range of interest for the gap (in seconds) for opponent information given by the Spotter. For example, you can ask the Spotter to give you only information about an opponent, which as at least a minute behind you, but you want no more information, when he is 5 seconds or less behind you, since you then will have visual information in the mirrors. You can find the corresponding [settings](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Session-Settings) in the "Session Database".
  4. It is now possible to let the Strategist recalculate the currently chosen strategy from time to time in the background, while you are in a race. Whenever a better strategy can be found (also, when no valid strategy is available anymore), you will be informed and can decide what to do. You can find the corresponding [settings](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Session-Settings) in the "Session Database", as well as on the [*Strategy* tab](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/AI-Race-Strategist#tab-strategy) in "Race Settings". This settings allow you to specify, in what situations the current strategy should revised. See also the [revised documentation](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/AI-Race-Strategist#adjusting-the-strategy-during-a-race) about strategy handling during a race, to understand what the Strategist will do automatically and what not.
  5. Support for cup categories has been added to the multi-class management. It is now possible to create reports with cars splitted in cup categories and you can also configure the assistants to understand cup categories to give you gap and delta information with regards to your own category. You can find the corresponding [settings](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Session-Settings) in the "Session Database". In all interactive reports as well as in the "Race Center", you can use the [settings for the race reports](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Race-Reports#selecting-report-data) to specify, how the information about the different car classes and cup categories should be displayed.
  6. If driver categories are available in the simulator (Platinum, Gold, ...), they can be displayed in various reports as well. See the documentation for the ["Race Reports"](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Race-Reports#selecting-report-data) tool for information how to enable this.
  7. The "Strategy Workbench" has become a little bit *smarter*:
     - New stint length optimization rules based on data generated by machine learning have been included in the "Strategy Workbench". Will be active, if at least one optimization is enabled in the strategy optimizer. 
     - New tyre wear model based on data generated by machine learning have been included in the "Strategy Workbench". Will be active, if the *Tyre Usage* optimization is enabled in the strategy optimizer. The new approach gives the "Strategy Workbench" the ability to double-stint a tyre set, if necessary.
  8. The strategy scripting language has been extended with new functions and predicates. See the [extended documentation](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/AI-Race-Strategist#scenario-validation) for more information.
  9. Long running strategy simulations can now be canceled by pressing the ESC key.
  10. The data refresh frequency of the "Race Center" can now be configured, when holding down the control key and select the ["Synchronize"](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Keyboard-Modifiers) item in the "Session" menu.
  11. Fixed handling of *No tyre change* in pitstop preparation in "Race Center".
  12. Fixed handling of pitstop preparation in "Race Center", when no strategy has been selected.
  13. Fixed saving of tyre pressure data at the end of a solo session.

     - Announcement of the Green flag at race start.
	 - Information when direct opponents or the race leader enter the pit.
	 - Applause, when a new personal best lap time has been set.
	 - Information when the current session (Practice or Qualifying) is ending in 30, 15 or 5 minutes.
	 - Detailed information package, when the first half of a race session has been finished.
	 - Warning a few laps before the current stint is ending.

	 The configuration of "Race Spotter" plugin has been updated accordingly. See the [revised documentation](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/AI-Race-Spotter#alerts--information) for more information.
  5. Delta calculation has been improved again for the Spotter:
     - The delta history will be reset when a given car is in the pits.
	 - The delta history will also be reset when a car had a crash or a longer offtrack, which results in a lap time, which is far outside the standard deviation.
	 - Cars that are currently in the pits, will be ignored completely, thereby eliminating disturbing and unnecessary gap updates when you have the last valid position on the track.
  6. Improvements for the Race Strategist and Race Spotter when requesting gap informations:
     - When you ask for the gap to the car ahead or behind, it will be mentioned when this car is in the pits.
     - When you ask for the gap to the car ahead or behind, it will be mentioned whether this car is at least one lap up or one lap down.
  7. A couple of improvements for the automated strategy handling (Race Strategist, Race Engineer and Race Center):
     - When a strategy is recalculated / adjusted in "Race Center", an urgent pitstop is created when the currently mounted tyres are not suitable for the current weather conditions.
     - The Race Strategist can now [recalculate / adjust the currently active strategy](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/AI-Race-Strategist#strategy-handling) anytime during a race.
	   - New voice command for the Strategist to trigger the recalculation of the current strategy.
	   - New controller action ["StrategyRecommend"](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Plugins-&-Modes#plugin-race-strategist) for the "Race Strategist" plugin, which is equivalent to the above mentioned voice command, incl. a new icon in the Stream Deck icon set for this controller action.
	 - When the Strategist instructs the Race Engineer to plan and prepare a pitstop, the tyre compound as defined in the strategy will now also be transferred to the Engineer, which will select this specific compound for the tyre change.
	 - The Race Engineer now adjusts the fuel amount for the last stint when the pitstop has been triggered by the active strategy.
  8. Improvements for the Race Engineer:
     - Correct handling of all tyre compounds, incl. Intermediate compounds, for tyre recommendations and for automated pitstops. See the [Tyre Compounds](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Tyre-Compounds) chapter as well as the corrsponding notes for [tyre compound handling by the "Race Engineer"](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/AI-Race-Engineer#how-it-works) for more information.
	 - Voice commands for tyre compound specification now also accept *Intermediate* as keyword.
	 - Engine damage will now be detected and corresponding repair recommendations will be issued.
	   - Damage will be detected for the simulators *Assetto Corsa*, *Automobilista 2*, *Project CARS 2* and *RaceRoom Racing Experience*.
	   - Engine repair will be handled automatically during pitstops for those simulators, which support this.
	   - New voice command to enable or disable engine repairs during the preparation of automated pitstops.
	   - "Race Settings" has been extended, so that you can configure the recommendation rule for engine repairs.
	   - A new default setting has been added to the "Session Database" for the engine repair recommendation as well.
  9. Improvements for the Strategy Workbench:
     - The strategy simulation will always try to use the optimal tyre compound for the selected weather conditions. So, if you start with dry tyres in wet conditions, an immediate pitstop will be planned.
	 - The available tyre cmpounds for the given simulator / car / track combination will be automatically preloaded into the Tyre Sets list in the Pitstop Rules group.
	 - Full support for a weather forecast model. See the [extended documentation](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Strategy-Workbench#weather) for more details.

  4. The Spotter can now create track maps for most simulators. These maps are then used in "Race Center" to give you a [live view](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Team-Center#data-analysis) of the current race situation. See the new [documentation](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/AI-Race-Spotter#track-mapping) for more information, how the track mapping actually works.
  5. A new meta-model for tyre compounds has been added, which allow you to describe the tyre compounds used for the various cars in all simulators and how these simulator specific tyre compounds map to the internal compound descriptors of Simulator Controller. A complete new [documentation chapter](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Tyre-Compounds) covers this topic. Don't miss it.
  6. Schema specifiers has been added to the [export meta data](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/AI-Race-Engineer#importing-data-from-other-sources), so that you are able to import data from foreign sources, for eexample telemetry data from real cars.
  7. A new preset has been added to "Simulator Setup", which helps you in creating a [patch file](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Installation-&-Configuration#patching-the-configuration) for the generated configuration. Patch files allow you to change all aspects of configurations generated by "Simulator Setup", for example the names and voices of the Race Assistants.
  8. A delay can now be configured in the "Session Database" for the keyboard commands used when dialing pitstop settings in the various simulators. This helps me to fix problems in rare cases, where the PC is quite old and unable to process the fast keyboard commands issued by Simulator Controller.
  9. A new "TyreCompound" action has been added to the "RaceRoom Racing Experience" plugin which allows you to change the tyre compound for the next pitstop. See the [revised documentation](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Plugins-&-Modes#configuration-8) for more information.

With this functionality, you can have a GT3 look and feel, a Rallye look and feel, an F1 look and feel, and so on. For an introduction to themes, please take a look at the [documentation](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Installation-&-Configuration#themes-editor).

     Important: You either need to use the themes editor of the [configuration tool](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Installation-&-Configuration#configuration) to configure your own splash themes or you need to copy the "[Splash Themes]" and "[Splash Window]" sections from 
*Resources\Templates\Simulator Configuration.ini* to your local configuration file found in *Simulator Controller\Config* in your user *Documents* folder. Also, be sure to update the runtime configuration of *Simulator Startup.exe* and *Simulator Tools.exe* by holding the Control key down while starting these applications.
  5. Added a special startup handler for Tactile Feedback (SimHub).
  
     Important: If you already defined your own configuration using the setup tool, please set "startSimHub" as the special startup handler for the "Tactile Feedback" application in the [Applications tab](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Installation-&-Configuration#tab-applications) of the setup tool.
