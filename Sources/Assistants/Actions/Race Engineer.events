fuel_low=Assistant.Class|FuelLowEvent|FuelLow||2|This event is triggered when the car is running low on fuel.
tyre_wear=Assistant.Class|TyreWearEvent|TyreWear||2|This event is triggered when at least one of the tyres has too much tread wear.
brake_wear=Assistant.Class|BrakeWearEvent|BrakeWear||2|This event is triggered when at least one of the brake pads is worn out.
damage_detected=Assistant.Class|DamageEvent|Damage||3|This event is triggered when new damage has been detected on the car.
damage_time_loss=Assistant.Class|TimeLossEvent|TimeLoss||2|This event is triggered after it has become clear, that the damage costs too much time per lap.
damage_no_time_loss=Assistant.Class|NoTimeLossEvent|NoTimeLoss||2|This event is triggered after the driver recovered his pace and repairs may no longer be needed.
pressure_loss=Assistant.Class|PressureLossEvent|PressureLoss||2|This event is triggered when a loss of pressure on a given tyre is detected.
