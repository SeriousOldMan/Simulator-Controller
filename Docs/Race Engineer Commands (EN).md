Below you will find a complete list of all voice commands recognized by Jona, the AI Race Engineer together with a short introduction into the syntax of the phrase grammars.

## Syntax

1. Reserved characters

   The characters **[**  **]**  **{**  **}**  **(**  **)** and the  **,**  itself are all special characters and may not be used as part of normal words.
   
2. Phrases

   A phrase is a part of a sentence or even a complete sentence. It may contain any number of words separated by spaces, but none of the reserved characters. It may contain alternative parts (either direct or referenced by name) as defined below. Examples:
   
		Mary wants an icecream

		(TellMe) your name?
		
		What is { the, the current } time?
		
   The first example is a simple phrase. The second one allows for choices as defined by the variable *TellMe* (see below), and the third example uses a local choice and stands for "What is the time?" and "What is the current time?".


3. Choices

   Using this syntax alternative parts of a phrase can be defined. Alternative (sub-)phrases must be enclosed by **{** and **}** and must be seperated by commas. Each (sub-)phrase may contain only simple words. Example:
   
		{ pressures, tyre pressures }

   If a given list of choices is used in several phrases, a variable may be defined for it and a variable reference (the name of the choices list enclosed by **(** and **)**) may be used instead of explicit syntax. All predefined choices are listed in the section "[Choices]" of the [grammar file](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/blob/main/Sources/Assistants/Grammars/Choices.en) and look like this:

		TellMe=Can you tell me, Please tell me, Tell me, Can you give me, Please give me, Give me

   This predefined choices list can be referenced by using *(TellMe)* as part of a phrase.

4. Commands

   A full command is either a phrase as defined above or a list of phrases separated by commas and enclosed in **[** and **]**. Each of these phrases can trigger the command on its own. Examples:

		(WhatAre) {the tire pressures, the current tire pressures, the pressures in the tires}
		
		[(TellMe) the time, What time is it, What is the {current time, time}]

   The first example is a single phrase, but with inner choices (alternatives). The second example defines three independent phrases for the command, even with inner choices.
